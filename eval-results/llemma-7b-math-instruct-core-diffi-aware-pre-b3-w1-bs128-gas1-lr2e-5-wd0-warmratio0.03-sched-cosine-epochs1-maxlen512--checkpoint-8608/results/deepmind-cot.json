Next, we perform the operations in the denominator of the fraction: ((-10)/(-15)) = (10*15)/(15*-10) = (150)/(-10) = -15.

Since the variables are the same on both sides, we can subtract 9*v from both sides, to get 18 = 18.

Factoring out -10002*v, we get -10002*v*(9/10002) = -18/10002, which simplifies to -v = -18/10002.  Multiplying both sides by -1, we get v = 18/10002.  Therefore, the solution is v = 18/10002.

This simplifies further to -o + 27/5*o - 12 + p = 0, which gives us o = 12 - p + 27/5*o.

Substituting this expression for $d$ into the second equation, we get $0 = 5p - 4(-5d + 15p) - 4 = 20p + 20d - 4$. We can solve for $p$ by adding $4$ and 20 to both sides, giving $0 = 20p + 20d + 4 = 20p + 20( -5d + 15p) + 4 = 20p - 100p + 300p + 4 = 300p - 100p + 4 = 200p + 4$.

    "output": "Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get -3*(-2*k + 3*b + 11) = 2*b - 20. Cancelling a 'b' on either side gives -6*k + 3*b + 33 = 2*b - 20. Combining like terms, we get -6*k + b = -13. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get 6*k - b = 13. Adding this to the original equation we had, we get -2*k + 3*b + 11 + 6*k - b = 2 + 13. Cancelling a 'b' on either side gives -k + 11 + 6*k = 15. Adding k to both sides, we get 5*k + 11 = 15. Subtracting 11 from both sides gives 5*k = 4. Dividing both sides by 5, we get k = 0.4. Substituting this value into the equation -3*k = 2*b - 20, we get -3*0.4 = 2*b - 20. Adding 20 to both sides gives -3*0.4 + 20 = 2*b. Dividing both sides by 2, we get -6 + 20 = b. Adding 6 to both sides gives 14 = b. Substituting this value into the equation -2*k + 3*b + 11 = 2, we get -2*0.4 + 3*14 + 11 = 2. Cancelling a '2' on the left side gives -k + 42 + 11 = 2. Adding k to both sides gives 43 + 11 = 2 + k. Subtracting 11 from both sides gives 54 = 2 + k. Subtracting 2 from both sides gives 52 = k. The prime factors of a are 52, 2, and 13, so a = 2*13*52 = \\boxed{1364}. The answer is 1364",

    "output": "First, we combine like terms on the left side of the first equation: -25*j + 3*i = -20*j + 31 becomes -2*j + 3*i = 31.  Then, we multiply through by -5 to solve for j: -5*(-2*j + 3*i) = -5*31, so -10*j + 15*i = -155.  We can then multiply through by -15 to solve for j: -15*(-10*j + 15*i) = -15*(-155), so 150*j - 225*i = 23125.  Finally, we divide by -225 to find j: (150*j - 225*i)/-225 = 23125/225, so j = 10 - 10*i.  Substituting this into the second equation gives: -5*i - 15 = 5*(10 - 10*i), so -5*i - 15 = 50 - 50*i.  Adding 15 to both sides gives: -5*i = 35 - 50*i, so 55*i = 35, and i = 35/55 = 7/11.  Substituting i = 7/11 into j = 10 - 10*i gives: j = 10 - 10*(7/11) = 10 - 70/11 = -60/11.  Thus, j = -60/11.

    "output": "Substituting the first equation into the second, we get -4*(-v + 2*t) + 5*t + 12 = 0, or 4*v - 8*t + 5*t + 12 = 0. Combining like terms, we get 4*v - 3*t + 12 = 0. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 4*v - 3*t = -12. Substituting the second equation into the third, we get -v*a = -4*a + 13, or v*a - 4*a + 13 = 0. Combining like terms, we get (v - 4)*a + 13 = 0. Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get (v - 4)*a = -13. Dividing both sides by 4*a, we get v - 4 = -13/a. Adding 4 to both sides, we get v = -13/a + 4. Substituting this last equation into the first, we get -13/a*(-v + 2*t) + 5*t + 12 = 0. Substituting v = -13/a + 4 into the first equation, we get -13/a*(-13/a + 4 + 2*t) + 5*t + 12 = 0. Multiplying both sides by a, we get -13*(-13/a + 4 + 2*t) + 5*t*a + 12*a = 0. Expanding, we get 169/a - 13*2*t + 5*t*a + 12*a = 0. Simplifying, we get 169/a + 5*t*a - 26*t - 12*a = 0. Adding 26*t + 12*a to both sides, we get 169/a + 5*t*a = 26*t + 12*a. Subtracting 169/a from both sides, we get 5*t*a = 26*t + 12*a - 169/a. Dividing both sides by 5*a, we get t = (26*t + 12*a - 169/a)/5. Substituting a = -13 into the last equation, we get t = (26*t + 12*-13 - 169/-13)/5. Simplifying, we get t = (26*t - 240)/5. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 5*t = 26*t - 240. Subtracting 26*t from both sides, we get -21*t = -240. Dividing both sides by -21, we get t = 12. Substituting t = 12 into the second equation, we get -4*v + 5*12 + 12 = 0. Solving for v, we get v = -5*12/4 + 12 = -15 + 12 = -3. Substituting v = -3 and t = 12 into the third equation, we get -3*a = -4*a + 13. Subtracting -4*a from both sides, we get 3*a = 13. Dividing both sides by 3, we get a = 13/3. The remainder when 36 is divided by a is 36 - 13/3 = 17. The answer is 17",

We can substitute this value for i into the first equation, to get 30 - 30 = -5t + 7 + 8. We can then combine like terms, to get -5t = 30 - 31 + 7 + 8 = 36 - 31 = 5.

We can then multiply, to get -2i - 2 - 31 = 5. We can then add 2 and 31 to both sides, to get -2i = 36.
