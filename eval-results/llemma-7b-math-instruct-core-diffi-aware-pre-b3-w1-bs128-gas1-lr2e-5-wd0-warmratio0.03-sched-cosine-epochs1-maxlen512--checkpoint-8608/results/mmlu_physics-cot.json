It is a well-known fact that the voltage across a capacitor is directly proportional to the charge stored on it. In other words, if V is the voltage across the capacitor when it is storing a charge Q, then we have the relation V = Q/C, where C is the capacitance of the capacitor.\nNow, if you have two capacitors hooked in parallel to an external circuit, it means that the voltage across them is identical. Therefore, if one of the capacitors is storing a charge Q, the other one is storing a charge 2Q. That is, 2Q = C*V. From this, it follows that C = Q/V = 2Q/(2V) = 2C1, where C1 is the capacitance of the first capacitor. Therefore, the capacitance of both capacitors is the same.\nThe answer is E.",

The speed at the top of the trajectory may be non-zero if the projectile is launched with an initial speed that is sufficiently large. However, if the projectile is launched with a smaller initial speed, the speed at the top will be zero.\nC The object's total speed remains constant during the entire flight.\nThis is not true.
