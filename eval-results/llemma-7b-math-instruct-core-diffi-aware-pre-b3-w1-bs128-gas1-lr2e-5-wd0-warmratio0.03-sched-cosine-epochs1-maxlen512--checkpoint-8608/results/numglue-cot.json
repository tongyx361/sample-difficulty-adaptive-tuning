    "output": "Let the cost of a pencil be $x$ and the cost of a pen be $y$. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. The equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n4x + 5y &= 2.00 \\\\\n3x + 4y &= 1.58 \\\\\n\\end{align*}We are trying to find the value of $y$, which is the cost of a pen. To solve for $y$, we need to eliminate $x$ from the equations above. Multiplying both sides of the second equation by 5 and both sides of the first equation by 4, we obtain:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n12x + 20y &= 6.20 \\\\\n15x + 20y &= 7.90 \\\\\n\\end{align*}Now we subtract the second equation from the first. This gives us $(12x - 15x) + (20y - 20y) = 6.20 - 7.90$, which simplifies to $-3x = -1.70$. Dividing both sides by $-3$, we get $x = 0.567$. We can now find $y$ by substituting $x = 0.567$ into either equation. Using the first equation, we get $4(0.567) + 5y = 2$, which gives us $5y = 1.00$ and $y = 0.20$.

    "question": "A boat travels 45 miles upstream in 5 hours. The boat travels the same distance downstream in 3 hours. What is the speed of the current in miles per hour?",
    "output": "Let $s$ be the speed of the current in miles per hour. The speed of the boat traveling upstream is $s - 45/5 = s - 9$ miles per hour, and the speed of the boat traveling downstream is $s + 45/3 = s + 15$ miles per hour. In general, if a boat travels $d$ miles upstream in $t$ hours, then it travels $d/(t - d/s)$ miles downstream in $t$ hours. So we have $$45/(5 - 9/s) = 45/(5 - s/9) = 15.$$ Solving for $s$, we find $s = \\boxed{15}$. The answer is 15",

Solve this system of equations to find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch , in dollars.",
    "output": "Let L be the monthly rental charge for the leather couch and M be the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch. We are trying to find the value of L. We can set up a system of equations to represent the given information. The first equation is the standard form for the cost of renting a leather couch for 8 months: 8L = 8(L + 30) = 8L + 240. The second equation is the standard form for the cost of renting a microfiber couch for 12 months: 12M = 12(M + 30) = 12M + 360. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 8L + 240 = 12M + 360. This simplifies to 8L = 12M + 120. We can divide both sides of this equation by 8 to give L = 1.5M + 15. We do not have to solve for M since we know that L = 1.5M + 15 is the cost of renting a leather couch for 1 month. Therefore, the monthly rental charge for a leather couch is 1.5 * 30 + 15 = 45 + 15 = 60 dollars. The answer is 60",
