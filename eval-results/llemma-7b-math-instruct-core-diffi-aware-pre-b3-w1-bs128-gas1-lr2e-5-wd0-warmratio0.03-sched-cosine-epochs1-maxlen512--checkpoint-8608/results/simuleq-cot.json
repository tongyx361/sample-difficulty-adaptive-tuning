    "output": "Let's say x number of Model A's will be produced and y number of Model B's will be produced. We know that x and y must be whole numbers (they represent the number of toys produced) and that x+y=5800 (they must add up to the total number of hours allowed). Furthermore, we know that the cost of producing x number of Model A's is 4*8*x=32x dollars and that the cost of producing y number of Model B's is 3*7*y=21y dollars. We also know that the total cost must be 12600 dollars. Therefore, we must have 32x+21y=12600. We can now solve this system of equations by substitution. We know that x+y=5800 and that x=5800-y. We can now substitute the second equation into the first equation and get 32(5800-y)+21y=12600. Canceling out the y's, we get 17600-32y+21y=12600. This simplifies to 9y=5000. Dividing both sides by 9, we get y=500. Substituting this value back into x+y=5800, we get x=5800-500=5300. So, the manufacturer will produce 5300 Model A's and 500 Model B's. The answer is 5300",

The first equation will represent the downstream rowing: $26=2x+2y$. The second equation will represent the upstream rowing: $26=4x-4y$. Solving this system will give us Rowan's rate in still water and the rate of the current.\n\nWe can subtract the second equation from the first to obtain $0=2x+2y-4x+4y$. Simplifying this equation gives $0=2y-2x$. Dividing both sides by $2$ gives $0=y-x$. This represents the fact that the rate of the current is half Rowan's rate in still water. We can plug $y=\\frac{1}{2}x$ into either equation to solve for $x$, and then we can plug this value into the equation $y=\\frac{1}{2}x$ to solve for $y$.

The total income from the first investment is 8.5/100*x, and the total income from the second investment is 6.4/100*(8000-x). The total income from both investments is 575 dollars. Therefore we have the equation: 8.5/100*x + 6.4/100*(8000-x) = 575. By multiplying through the parentheses, we get 8.5x/100 + 5280-6.4x/100 = 575. We combine like terms to get 2.1x/100 = 505.

    "output": "Let the smaller part be $x$ and the larger part be $y$. We are given that $0.40x = 0.625y + 10$, or re-arranging, $0.40x - 0.625y = 10$. We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to obtain $4x - 62.5y = 100$. Now we subtract $4x$ from both sides to obtain $-62.5y = -3x + 100$. We can solve for $y$ to get $y = \\frac{1}{62.5}(3x - 100)$. We see that $y$ is an integer if $3x-100$ is divisible by 625, and that $y$ is the larger part. We want $0.4x$ to be larger than $0.625y$ by 10, so we want $0.4x$ to be larger than $0.625y$ by 10. We solve for $x$ to get $x = \\frac{1}{0.4}(100 + 625y)$. We want $x$ to be an integer, so we want $100 + 625y$ to be divisible by 4. We note that if $y$ is a positive integer, then $100 + 625y$ is divisible by 4 if and only if $y = 4k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$, so the possible values of $y$ are 4, 8, 12, 16, etc. The possible values of $y$ are 4, 8, 12, 16, etc. The only value of $y$ that works is 4, which gives $x = \\frac{1}{0.4}(100 + 625\\cdot 4) = 1250$.

Therefore, 30x+50y=18360. Since the company turns out three times as many units of plywood as lumber, y=3x. Substituting y=3x into the equation 30x+50y=18360, we get 30x+50(3x)=18360. This simplifies to 30x+150x=18360. Adding 150x and 30x, we get 180x=18360. Dividing both sides by 180, we get x=102. Substituting x=102 into y=3x, we get y=3(102)=306.

The equations are: 1) 3F + 1S = 155 and 2) 2F + 3S = 220. We are trying to find the values of F and S. In equation 1, we can solve for F by subtracting 1S from both sides. 3F = 155 - 1S We can then divide both sides by 3 to find F = 51 - 0.33S. In equation 2, we can solve for S by subtracting 2F from both sides. 3S = 220 - 2F We can then divide both sides by 3 to find S = 70 - 0.67F. We are looking for the values of F and S, so we can set the two expressions for F equal to each other and solve for S. 51 - 0.33S = 70 - 0.67S We then multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get: 5100 - 33S = 7000 - 67S We then subtract 5100 from both sides to get: -20S = -1900 We then divide both sides by -20 to get: S = 95 We then substitute 95 for S into the expression for F to get: F = 51 - 0.33(95) = 51 - 30.45 = 20.55 Therefore, the cost of a football is 20.55 dollars and the cost of a soccer ball is 95 dollars.

    "output": "Let C be the number of crocus bulbs and D be the number of daffodil bulbs. We can write the equation as follows: 0.35C + 0.65D = 29.15. We can also write the equation 0.35C + 0.65D = 29.15, but with the variables C and D swapped. To solve the system of equations, we can subtract one equation from the other. 0.35C + 0.65D = 29.15 - 0.65C - 0.35D = 29.15 - 1.00C - 0.35D = 0.00. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get 35C + 65D = 2915. We can subtract 35C from both sides to get 65D = 2915 - 35C = 2915 - 35(6) = 2915 - 210 = 2705. We can then divide both sides by 65 to get D = 2705 / 65 = 42. Substituting D = 42 into the second equation gives 0.35C + 0.65(42) = 29.15, or 0.35C + 29.15 = 29.15. Subtracting 29.15 from both sides gives 0.35C = 0, and dividing both sides by 0.35 gives C = 0. We know that C is the number of crocus bulbs, and D is the number of daffodil bulbs, so there are 42 daffodil bulbs and 0 crocus bulbs. The answer is 42",

    "output": "Let x be the number of milliliters of the 5% solution and y be the number of milliliters of the 10% solution. We know that x + y = 50 and we want to solve for y.\nTo start, we need to set up an equation for the percentage of acetic acid in the final solution. We know that 5% of x and 10% of y are 0.05x and 0.10y, respectively. Since these sum to 0.09(50), we can write the equation: 0.05x + 0.10y = 0.09(50).\nNext, we solve for y by subtracting 0.05x from both sides: 0.10y = 0.09(50) - 0.05x = 4.5 - 0.05x.\nWe can then divide both sides by 0.10 to find y = 4.5/0.10 - 0.05x/0.10 = 45 - 0.5x.\nWe know that x + y = 50, so we can substitute y = 45 - 0.5x into the first equation to get x + 45 - 0.5x = 50.\nCombining like terms, we get 0.5x = 5, so x = 5 / 0.5 = 10.\nSince x is 10 milliliters, y = 45 - 0.5*10 = 35 milliliters.\nThe answer is 10",

We now solve this system of equations by substitution.\n\nSubstituting $b=80-a$ into $20a+60b=3600$, we get $20a+60(80-a)=3600$, which simplifies to $10a=240$. Dividing by 10, we get $a=24$, and $b=80-a=\\boxed{56}$. The answer is 56",
