    "question": "Kathy is a repair technician for a phone company. Each week, she receives a batch of phones that need repairs. The number of phones that she has left to fix at the end of each day can be estimated with the equation $P=108-23 d$, where $P$ is the number of phones left and $d$ is the number of days she has worked that week. What is the meaning of the value 108 in this equation? \nAnswer Choices: (A) Kathy will complete the repairs within 108 days. (B) Kathy starts each week with 108 phones to fix. (C) Kathy repairs phones at a rate of 108 per hour. (D) Kathy repairs phones at a rate of 108 per day.",
    "output": "The meaning of the value 108 is most clearly seen when we look at the equation in the context of the problem. We are told that $P=108-23d$ is an equation that Kathy can use to estimate the number of phones left to fix at the end of each day. This equation tells us that the number of phones left is equal to 108 phones minus 23 phones per day. At first, this may seem like a strange way to express the idea, but it makes more sense when we realize that 23 is the rate at which she repairs phones each day. If she repairs phones at a rate of 23 per day, then in 7 days, she will have repaired 23*7=161 phones. We can then subtract the number of phones repaired from the total number of phones to find the number of phones left to fix: 108-161=47 phones. So, the value of 108 in the equation $P=108-23d$ is the number of phones that Kathy starts with at the beginning of the week. The answer is B.",

The range will increase the most since it is based on the two extreme values in the data set. The mean and median will increase by a similar amount. While the mean and median will shift upward, the range will decrease slightly. The range is the difference between the greatest and the least value.

    "output": "We can solve the system by graphing the two inequalities. If $(0,0)$ is a solution, that is, if both inequalities are true when $x=0$, then the graph of the inequalities intersect at the point $(0,0)$. (When $x=0$, only the point $(0,0)$ lies on both graphs.) This is shown below:\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(4);\n\nxaxis(-3,3,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nyaxis(-3,3,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\ndraw((0,-3)--(0,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-3,0)--(3,0),linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3),linewidth(1)+linetype(\"4 4\"));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,-3),linewidth(1)+linetype(\"4 4\"));\n\ndot((0,0));\n[/asy] The shaded region is where both inequalities are true. Now, we need to find a relationship between $a$ and $b$ that is a necessary condition for $(0,0)$ to be a solution. Observe that if $x$ is negative, then the first inequality is satisfied regardless of the value of $a$, and if $x$ is positive, then the second inequality is satisfied regardless of the value of $b$. Therefore, for $(0,0)$ to be a solution, it must be true that the shaded region includes the point $(0,0)$. This is possible if and only if the \"corners\" of the shaded region, namely $(0,3)$, $(0,-3)$, $(3,0)$, and $(-3,0)$, are all on the same side of the line $y=x$. In other words, the shaded region must be symmetric about the line $y=x$. The shaded region is symmetric about the line $y=-x$, so the region is also symmetric about the line $y=0$. Therefore, the shaded region is symmetric about the $y$-axis.\n\nNow, we know that when $x=0$, we must have $y>0$ and $y<-x+a$. Thus, when $x=0$, we must have $y>0$ and $y<-a$. This is only possible if $a<0$. (If $a$ were positive, then $y$ would be less than $0$ when $x=0$, which contradicts the given condition.) Therefore, we must have $|a|>|b|$.

    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question step by step.\nThe left side represents the product of two polynomials, so the degree of the polynomial on the left side must be the product of the degrees of the two polynomials. The degree of $(ax+3)$ is 1 and the degree of $(5x^2-bx+4)$ is 2, so the degree of the product $(ax+3)(5x^2-bx+4)$ is 1+2=3. That means that the $x^3$ term in the expansion of $(ax+3)(5x^2-bx+4)$ must have a coefficient of 20. Since the coefficient of the $x^3$ term in the expansion of $(ax+3)(5x^2-bx+4)$ is $5a+3(-b)$, we solve $5a+3(-b)=20$ to find $a$. We can solve for $b$ similarly by observing that the coefficient of the $x^2$ term in the expansion of $(ax+3)(5x^2-bx+4)$ is $5(-b)+3a$. We get the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n5a+3(-b) &= 20\\\\\n5(-b)+3a &= -9\n\\end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by 5 and subtracting the second equation from it gives $75a-15b=100$. Multiplying the second equation by $-3$ and subtracting the first equation from it gives $-20a-9b=-24$. We can solve this system of equations for $a$ and $b$ and then calculate $ab$. We get the solution $a=4$, $b=-3$, so $ab=\\boxed{12}$.\n\nAlternatively, we note that the expansion of $(ax+3)(5x^2-bx+4)$ is of the form $pax^3+qax^2+(ra+sb)x+3(4)$, where $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ are constants. Since the coefficient of $x^3$ in the expansion is $5a+3(-b)$, $p$ must equal 5. Since the coefficient of $x^2$ in the expansion is $5(-b)+3a$, $q$ must equal 3. Since the coefficient of $x$ in the expansion is $5(-2b)+3(2a)$, $r$ must equal 2. Since the constant coefficient in the expansion is $5(-3b)+3(4a)$, $s$ must equal $-3$. Thus, we must have $5a+3(-b)=20$, $5(-b)+3a=-9$, $5(-2b)+3(2a)=-2$, and $5(-3b)+3(4a)=12$. Solving these equations for $a$ and $b$ gives $a=4$ and $b=-3$, so $ab=12$.\n\nThe answer is 12",
