    "question": "Let h be ((-8)/(-3))/((-10)/(-15)). Let w be (0 + -2)/2 - -4. Suppose 4*y = 5*s + 84 - 33, -w*y + h*s = -39. List the prime factors of y.",
    "output": "First, we need to find h. We begin by performing the division in the numerator of the fraction, getting -8/(-3) = 8/3. Next, we divide 8/3 by -10/15, performing the division in the numerator first, getting 8/3 / -10/15 = -8/10. We simplify to get -8/10 = -4/5. So, h = -4/5. We then find w by performing the arithmetic in the numerator first, getting 0 + -2 = -2. We then divide this by 2, performing the division in the numerator first, getting -2/2 = 1. So, w = 1. We then subtract 1 from -4/5, performing the subtraction in the numerator first, to get -4/5 - 1 = -9/5. We now have all the values we need to start solving the equation. We multiply the first equation by 4, giving 4*y = 5*s + 34. We then subtract 84 from both sides of this equation, giving 4*y - 84 = 5*s + 34 - 84. This simplifies to 4*y - 84 = 5*s - 50. We now multiply the second equation by 5, giving -9/5*y + 4/5*s = -39. We then add 84 to both sides of this equation, giving -9/5*y + 4/5*s + 84 = -39 + 84. This simplifies to -9/5*y + 4/5*s + 84 = 45. So, we now have two equations with the same number of equations and unknowns, so we can solve them simultaneously. We begin by multiplying the first equation by 4/5, giving 4*y - 84*4/5 = 5*s - 50*4/5. This simplifies to 4*y - 67.2 = 5*s - 10. Multiplying the second equation by -9/5 gives -9/5*y + 4/5*s + 84*-9/5 = -39*-9/5. This simplifies to -9/5*y - 18.8 + 84*-9/5 = 36.3. Adding these two equations gives 3*y - 106.2 = 26.3. Solving for y gives y = 106.5/3 = 35.5. The prime factors of y are 3, 5, and 11. So, the prime factors of y are 3, 5, and 11. The answer is 3,5,11",

    "output": "Notice that 158*o and 163*o differ by 5*o. Therefore, 5*o must be a multiple of 4615. Since 5*o is a multiple of 5, o must be a multiple of 13*11*5 = 1455. Therefore, o = 1455*k for some integer k. Plugging this in to the equation 158*o + 4615 = 163*o, we get 158*1455*k + 4615 = 163*1455*k, so 1455*k*(158 + 5) = 4615*163*k. The units digit of 158 + 5 is 0, so 4615*163*k must end in a 0. Therefore, since 4615 is a multiple of 5, 163*k must be a multiple of 5. The units digit of 163 is 3, so the units digit of 3k must be 5. Therefore, the units digit of k is 5, so the units digit of i is 5 - 1458 = 9. Therefore, the units digit of i is 9.\n\nAlternatively, you can notice that 4615 = 15*11*13, so 158*o + 4615 = 158*o + 15*11*13 = 15*(11*o + 13). Since 11*o is a multiple of 11, 11*o + 13 is a multiple of 11, so 15*(11*o + 13) is a multiple of 15*11 = 165, which is a multiple of 5. Therefore, 163*o + 4615 is a multiple of 5, so 163*o must also be a multiple of 5. Therefore, the units digit of o must be 5, so the units digit of i is 5 - 1458 = 9. The answer is 9",

    "output": "Subtracting 2*o from both sides of the first equation gives 4*o - 2*o = 5*t - 2*o - 16, which simplifies to 2*o = 5*t - 16. Solving the second equation for t gives t = (a*t - 12) / 2, which simplifies to t = (12 - a*t) / 2. Substituting both sides of the second equation into the first equation gives 2*o = 5*(12 - a*t) / 2 - 16, which simplifies to 2*o = 60 - 5*a*t. Adding 5*a*t - 16 to both sides of the second equation gives 2*o + 5*a*t - 16 = 60, which simplifies to 2*o + a*t = 76. Subtracting 2*o from both sides of the second equation gives a*t - 2*o = 76 - 2*o, which simplifies to a*t - 2*o = 76. Substituting 5*t - 16 for 2*o in the previous equation gives a*t - 5*t + 16 = 76, which simplifies to (a - 5)*t = 60. Substituting (12 - a*t) / 2 for t in the previous equation gives (a - 5)(12 - a*t) / 2 = 60, which simplifies to (a - 5)(12 - a*t) = 120. Expanding the previous equation gives a*a*t - 12*a + 60 = 120, which simplifies to a*a*t - 12*a + 60 = 120. Subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation gives a*a*t - 12*a = 60, which factors as a*(a*t - 12) = 60. Since b = 172 + 96 and a = b + -265, substituting 172 + 96 for b and -265 for a in the previous equation gives (172 + 96)*(12 - 172 - 96) = 60, which simplifies to (172 + 96)*(-96) = 60. This simplifies to (172 + 96)*96 = 60, which simplifies to 172*96 + 96*96 = 60. This simplifies to 160*96 = 60, which simplifies to 160*4 = 1. Since 1 / 4 = 0.25, o = 0.25. The answer is 0.25",

Therefore l(b) = 2*b**2 + 42*b + 14. l(-5) = 2*(-5)**2 + 42*(-5) + 14 = 2*25 - 210 + 14 = -166. Let's solve -y + 6 = -166*g + 8*g, 3*y - 5 = g.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get v*b - 13 = 4*p - 3*p.  Simplifying, we get v*b - 13 = p.  Substituting b = -2*p/3, we get v*(-2*p/3) - 13 = p, or v*p/3 + 13 = p.  Multiplying both sides by 3, we get v*p + 39 = 3*p.  Subtracting 39 from both sides, we get v*p = -39.  Dividing both sides by v, we get p = -39/v.  Substituting this into the equation 2*p = -3*b, we get 2*(-39/v) = -3*b.  Simplifying, we get 78/v = b.  Therefore, b = 78/v, and v = 78/b.  The answer is \\frac{78}{b}",

Therefore, the only 7th power that divides 378069438 is $3^6$.  As a result, we have \\[378069438^{1/7} = 3^{6/7} \\cdot (2^6 \\cdot 17^2 \\cdot 19^2 \\cdot 23^2 \\cdot 29^2 \\cdot 31^2 \\cdot 37^2)^{1/7}.\\]Since $31 \\equiv -1 \\pmod 7$, we can multiply the factors of 378069438 by 31 and by $-1$, to get a smaller number whose 7th power is 378069438.

Because of the appearance of 1 and 6, we might expect that the power of 2, the product of the primes, and the product of the squares will be congruent to 1, 2, or 4 modulo 7.  We also have the possibility that the power of 2, the product of the primes, and the product of the squares will be congruent to 0 modulo 7.  We can check each of these four cases.  If the power of 2, the product of the primes, and the product of the squares are all congruent to 1 modulo 7, then their 7th root is congruent to 1 modulo 7.  If the power of 2, the product of the primes, and the product of the squares are all congruent to 2 modulo 7, then their 7th root is congruent to 2 modulo 7.  If the power of 2, the product of the primes, and the product of the squares are all congruent to 4 modulo 7, then their 7th root is congruent to 4 modulo 7.  Finally, if the power of 2, the product of the primes, and the product of the squares are all congruent to 0 modulo 7, then their 7th root is congruent to 0 modulo 7.  In any case, we must have that $378069438^{1/7}$ is congruent modulo 7 to $\\pm 1$, $\\pm 2$, or $\\pm 4$.

Subtracting 522 from both sides gives -16*n = -506.  Dividing both sides by -16 gives n = 31.  Filling in 0 = 28473*n - 28519*n + 506 we get 0 = 28473*31 - 28519*31 + 506, which simplifies to 0 = 8557 - 8551 + 506, which simplifies to 0 = 506, which has no solutions.  None of our steps were illegal, so our only mistake was in the first step of rewriting 28473*n - 28519*n as -16*n.  We assumed that 28473 - 28519 = -16, but this is only true if we assume that 0 = 28473 - 28519, which it does not.  The correct way to rewrite 28473*n - 28519*n is to use the distributive property to combine the terms, giving 0 = 28473*n - 28519*n + 0, so the correct solution is n = 31. The answer is 31",

    "output": "Let's solve the second equation first. Subtracting 5*w from both sides, we get -u = -10 - 5*w. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get u = 10 + 5*w. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get u = 5*w + 10. Substituting this into the first equation, we get -67 - 7 = -5*(5*w + 10) + w. This simplifies to -74 = -25*w + 50. Adding 25 to both sides, we get -29 = 25*w. Dividing both sides by 29, we get w = -1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get a - 2*a + 3*l = -26. Simplifying, we get a - 2*a + 3*l = -26. Subtracting 2*a from both sides, we get -a + 3*l = -26. Adding 26 to both sides, we get 3*l = 20. Dividing both sides by 3, we get l = 20/3. Substituting this into the first equation, we get -67 - 7 = -5*(5*(20/3) + 10) + w. This simplifies to -74 = -25*(20/3) + 50. Adding 25 to both sides, we get -29 = 25*(20/3). Dividing both sides by 29, we get -1 = 25*(20/3)/-29. This simplifies to -1 = (20/3)/-29. Multiplying both sides by -3, we get 1 = 20/29. Adding 20 to both sides, we get 21 = 20/29. Dividing both sides by 20, we get 21/20 = 1/29. Adding 1/29 to both sides, we get 1/20 = 1/29. Multiplying both sides by 20, we get 20/29 = 1. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 20/29 - 1 = 0.

Adding a - 160 to both sides of this equation gives -160 = 0, which simplifies to -160 = 0.  Since -160 = 0, we can conclude that 0 = 0.\nNow, we substitute 0 = 2*a - 0*a - 160 into the first equation to get -4*v + 4*n + n = 2*a - 0*a - 160.
