    "output": "Let X be the number of adults. The number of children is X+20. The cost of an adult's ticket is 6.75 dollars, so the theater's total earnings for adults is X*6.75. The cost of a children's ticket is 4.50, so the total earnings for children is (X+20)*4.50. The total earnings for the movie theater is 405 dollars. Thus, we have the equation: X*6.75 + (X+20)*4.50 = 405. Solving for X, we get: 6.75X + 4.50X + 90 = 405 11.25X + 90 = 405 11.25X = 315 X = 28 So, there are 28 adults and 28+20 = 48 children.

    "output": "Let's call the speed of the plane with the speed $x$ the speed of the plane with speed $x+40$ (since the plane flying at speed $x+40$ is faster than the one flying at speed $x$). After 5 hours, the plane flying at speed $x$ will have traveled $5x$ miles while the plane flying at speed $x+40$ will have traveled $5(x+40)$ miles. The total distance between them is 2000 miles, so we have the equation $5x+5(x+40)=2000$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=120$. Therefore, the faster plane is traveling at a speed of $120+40=160$ miles per hour. The slower plane is traveling at a speed of $120$ miles per hour. Therefore, the average speed of the two planes is $\\frac{120+160}{2}=\\boxed{140}$ miles per hour. The answer is 140",

We could solve this system by graphing, by substitution, or by elimination. In this case, the equations have been given to us already, so we can solve with the substitution method.

    "output": "Let w be the woman's waist size and h be her hip size. We are looking for the value of w when h = 35. If we let x be the maximum ideal waist size for a woman with 40 inch hips, then we can write two proportions to represent the given information. These proportions are w = x and h = 40. Cross multiplying the first proportion gives w*40 = x*32. Cross multiplying the second proportion gives 35*x = 32. Dividing the first equation by the second gives w*40/35 = x*32/x. Cancelling x from the right side gives 40/35 = 32/x. Solving for x gives x = 32*35/40 = 28. Therefore, the maximum ideal waist size for a woman with 35 inch hips is 28 inches. The answer is 28",

    "question": "3 footballs and 1 soccer ball cost 155 dollars. 2 footballs and 3 soccer balls cost 220 dollars. Determine the cost of 1 football and the cost of one soccer ball , in dollars. ",
    "output": "Let the cost of 1 football and the cost of 1 soccer ball be $f$ and $s$, respectively. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. The equations are:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n3f + s &= 155 \\\\\n2f + 3s &= 220 \\\\\n\\end{align*}We are trying to find the values of $f$ and $s$, so we need to eliminate one of them from the equations above. Multiplying both sides of the first equation by 3 and both sides of the second equation by 2 gives us the following system:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n9f + 3s &= 465 \\\\\n4f + 6s &= 440 \\\\\n\\end{align*}Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us, $5f+3s=115 \\Rightarrow f=\\frac{115-3s}{5}$. Substituting this expression into the first equation in order to eliminate $f$ gives us, $3(\\frac{115-3s}{5})+s=155 \\Rightarrow 13s=25 \\Rightarrow s=25/13=1.85$. Substituting this value into the equation $f=\\frac{115-3s}{5}$ gives us $f=\\frac{115-3(1.85)}{5}=\\boxed{15}$. The answer is 15",

In order to obtain 50 gallons of crude oil that is 55 % hydrocarbons , how many gallons of crude oil must be used from each of the two sources? ",
    "output": "Let x and y be the number of gallons of crude oil from each source, respectively. Since 50 gallons of crude oil is to be obtained, we have the equation x + y = 50. Now, the amount of crude oil obtained from the first source is 25 % of x, which is 0.25 x, and the amount of crude oil obtained from the second source is 75 % of y, which is 0.75 y. Since the total amount of crude oil obtained is 50 gallons, we have the equation 0.25 x + 0.75 y = 50. We now substitute y = 50 - x in the second equation, and we have 0.25 x + 0.75 (50 - x) = 50. This simplifies to 0.25 x + 37.5 - 0.75 x = 50, which simplifies to -0.5 x = -2.5. Therefore, x = 5, and y = 50 - 5 = 45. The answer is 5,45",

The value of the dimes is $10 \\cdot d \\cdot 10 \\text{ cents} = 100d \\text{ cents}$, and the value of the nickels is $10 \\cdot n \\cdot 1 \\text{ cent} = 10n \\text{ cents}$.  The total value of the dimes and nickels is $100d + 10n$, and this total is equal to the total value of the coins, $310 \\text{ cents}$.  So, we have the equation $100d + 10n = 310$.  If we divide both sides by $10$, we get  $$10d + n = 31.$$ Rearranging this equation gives $n = 31 - 10d$.  Substituting this expression into the equation $n + d = 36$ gives $31 - 10d + d = 36$, or $d = 5$.  Substituting this value into $n = 31 - 10d$ gives $n = 31 - 10 \\cdot 5 = 11$.

    "question": "One year Walt invested 12,000 dollars. He invested part of the money at 7 % and the rest at 9 %. He made a total of 970 dollars in interest. How much was invested at 7 %? ",
    "output": "Let x be the amount invested at 7 %. The amount invested at 9 % was x + 12000 - x = 12000 - x dollars. The interest earned at 7 % is x * 7 / 100 dollars. The interest earned at 9 % is (12000 - x) * 9 / 100 dollars. So, x * 7 / 100 + (12000 - x) * 9 / 100 = 970. By multiplying 100 through the parentheses, we get 7x + 108000 - 9x = 97000. By combining like terms, we get 2x = 11000. By dividing by 2, we get x = 5500 dollars. The answer is 5500",

We know that x + y = 5000.\nThe interest for the year is 4 x / 100 + 6.5 y / 100 = 245 pence.\nWe can write the equation 4 x / 100 + 6.5 y / 100 = 245 and solve for x.\nMultiplying by 100, we get 4 x + 6.5 y = 24500.\nSubtracting 4 x from both sides, we get 6.5 y = 24500 - 4 x.\nDividing both sides by 6.5, we get y = 3800 - 6.5 x.\nSubstituting y in the first equation, we get x + 3800 - 6.5 x = 5000.\nCombining like terms, we get 5 x = 5000 - 3800 = 1200.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get x = 240.\nSubstituting x = 240 in y = 3800 - 6.5 x, we get y = 3800 - 6.5 * 240 = 3800 - 1560 = 2240.\nThe answer is 240 pence and 2240 pence",

    "output": "Let X be the number of etchings that sold at 35 dollars. The number of etchings that sold at 45 dollars is 16-X. The total amount that he got from selling 16 etchings is 630 dollars. The total amount that he got from selling X etchings at 35 dollars is 35X. The total amount that he got from selling 16-X etchings at 45 dollars is 45(16-X). The total amount that he got from selling X etchings at 35 dollars and the rest at 45 dollars is equal to the total amount that he got from selling 16 etchings. Therefore, 35X+45(16-X)=630. 35X+720-45X=630. 20X=720-630. 20X=90. X=90/20. X=4.5 etchings. The number of etchings that sold at 45 dollars is 16-4.5=11.5. The answer is 4",

    "question": "At Al 's Rent-a-Center , it costs 30 dollars more per month to rent a leather couch than it does to rent a microfiber couch. Pauline rented a leather couch for 8 months and then exchanged it for a microfiber couch , which she rented for 12 months. She paid a total of 1620 dollars to rent these couches. Solve this system of equations to find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch , in dollars. Find the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch. ",
    "output": "Let L be the monthly rental charge for the leather couch and M be the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch.\nWe know that L = M + 30 and that L*8 + M*12 = 1620.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 8M + 240 + 12M = 1620.\nCombining like terms, we get 20M + 240 = 1620.\nSubtracting 240 from both sides, we get 20M = 1580.\nDividing both sides by 20, we get M = 79.\nSubstituting this value back into L = M + 30, we get L = 79 + 30 = 109 dollars.\nThe answer is 109",
