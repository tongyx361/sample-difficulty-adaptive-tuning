    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nLet $s$ and $d$ be the number of salads and drinks, respectively, sold. Then, the revenue comes from selling $s + d$ items for a total of $6.5s + 2d$ dollars.  Hence, we have the equation \\begin{align*}\n6.5s + 2d &= 836.50, \\\\\ns + d &= 209.\n\\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $4.5s = 627.5$, or $s = 143$. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get $d = 209 - 143 = 66$. Thus, $\\boxed{143}$ salads were sold that day. The answer is 143",

If $y=h(x)$ is graphed in the $x y$-plane, which of the following represents the real-life meaning of the positive $x$-intercept of the graph? \nAnswer Choices: (A) The initial height of the projectile (B) The maximum height of the projectile (C) The time at which the projectile reaches its maximum height (D) The time at which the projectile hits the ground",
    "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step.\nThe $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is given by $-b/2a$. In this case, $b=100$ and $a=-16$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=50/8$. This is the time at which the projectile reaches its maximum height.\nThe answer is C.",
