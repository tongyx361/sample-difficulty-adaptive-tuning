It means that it has to push the door mat with a force of 5 N.\nThe shopping cart moves at a speed of 8 m/s on the tile floor as a result of there being more friction on the tile floor. It means that it has to push the tile floor with a force of 8 N.\nSince it has to push the tile floor with a force of 8 N, it will push the door mat with a force of 8 / 5 = 1.6 N.\nThus, the force of friction on the door mat is 1.6 N.\nThis means that the force of friction on the tile floor is 8 - 1.6 = 6.4 N.\nThe answer is B.",

We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\nn+d&=207\\\\\n\\frac{5}{10}n+\\frac{10}{10}d&=17.55\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nMultiplying both sides of the second equation by 10, we have $5n+10d=175.5$, or $n+2d=35.1$.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from this last one, we have $d=35.1-n$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get $n+(35.1-n)=207$, or $n=84$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{84}$ nickels.\n\nAlternatively, we could solve the first equation for $d$ and substitute this into the second equation to get $84+d=17.55$, or $d=17.55-84=60.45$. Since there are only 10 dimes, we can't have more than 60 dimes, so we must have $\\boxed{84}$ nickels. The answer is 84",

If the train travels at 60 kph on the train tracks, then it covers 60*t kph in the same time. Since 60>10, the train covers more distance when traveling on the train tracks.",

This gives you x = 36 + 36 = 72\n6) Substitute x = 72 and y = -36 into the original equation 25% of x + 37.5% of y = 11.2 to check the answer. 25% of 72 + 37.5% of -36 = 18 + (-15) = 3, which is equal to 11.2.

Solve this system of equations to find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch , in dollars.",
    "output": "Let L be the monthly rental charge for the leather couch and M be the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch.\nWe know that L = M + 30 and that L*8 + M*12 = 1620.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get L*8 + (L + 30)*12 = 1620.\nThis simplifies to 8L + 960 = 1620.\nSubtracting 960 from both sides, we get 8L = 660.\nDividing both sides by 8, we get L = 85.\nThe answer is 85",

The total number of rolls sold was 480 rolls , and the total amount of money collected was 2,340.00 dollars. How many solid rolls were sold?",

This is because of the law of conservation of energy (which states that the total amount of energy in a system remains constant). In this case, the energy is the kinetic energy of the cart, which is equal to the product of the mass and the square of the speed. Therefore, since the speed decreases, the cart must have a greater mass on the tile floor than on the door mat.
