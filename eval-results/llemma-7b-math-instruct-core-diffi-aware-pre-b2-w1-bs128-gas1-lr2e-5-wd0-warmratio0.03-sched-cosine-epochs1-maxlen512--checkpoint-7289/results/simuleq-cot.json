Solving for $c$ and $p$ gives $c=16$ and $p=24$, so 16 pounds of Colombian beans and 24 pounds of Peruvian beans should be used.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The average cost of the coffee beans is $(5.5+4.25)/2=4.975$, but the desired average cost is $4.6$. Thus, the weighting factor for Colombian beans is $\\dfrac{4.6-4.25}{5.5-4.975}=\\dfrac{0.35}{0.525}=\\dfrac{10}{14}$ and the weighting factor for Peruvian beans is $1-\\dfrac{10}{14}=\\dfrac{4}{14}$.

    "output": "Let p be the number of orders of popcorn shrimp and c be the number of catfish dinners. We know that 3.5p + 6c = 133.50 and that p + c = 26.\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get 3.5p + 6c - (3.5p + 6c) = 133.50 - 26\nCombining like terms, we get 0.5p = 107\nDividing both sides by 0.5, we get p = 214\nSubstituting this value back into the equation p + c = 26, we get 214 + c = 26\nSubtracting 214 from both sides, we get c = 4\nThe answer is 4",

Since the total interest paid is $14,761.81$ dollars, we have $0.071xy=14,761.81$. Solving for $xy$, we get $xy=2,044,542.03$. Since $x+y=318,338$, we have $x=\\frac{318,338-y}{2}$.

    "output": "Let x be the price of a book on Thursday.\nSo, on Friday, the price of a book was x - 0.50.\nAnd since he sold 23 books on Thursday, the total revenue from Thursday is 23x.\nAnd since he sold 35 books on Friday, the total revenue from Friday is 35(x - 0.50).\nAnd the total revenue from both days is 23x + 35(x - 0.50).\nThis total revenue is 490, so 23x + 35(x - 0.50) = 490.\nBy simplifying the left side, we have 23x + 35x - 17.5 = 490.\nBy combining like terms, we have 58x = 507.5.\nSo the price of a book on Thursday is x = 507.5/58 = 8.75 dollars.\nAnd the price of a book on Friday is x - 0.50 = 8.75 - 0.50 = 8.25 dollars.\nThe answer is 8",

We set $d$ equal to the distance between the two planes, which is $2000$ miles. We can also find the total speed of the two planes by adding $x$ and $x+40$. We will call this speed $y$. Using the formula $d=rt$, we have: \\begin{align*}\n2000&=5(x+x+40) \\\\\n2000&=5(2x+40) \\\\\n2000&=10x+200 \\\\\n800&=10x \\\\\nx&=80\n\\end{align*} So the speed of the slower plane is $80$ mph and the speed of the faster plane is $80+40=120$ mph.

    "question": "How many liters of 5 % saline solution and 25 % saline solution must be mixed together to get 10 liters of 18 % saline solution?",
    "output": "Let $x$ be the number of liters of 5 % saline solution and $y$ be the number of liters of 25 % saline solution. 10 liters of 18 % saline solution is obtained by mixing $x$ liters of 5 % saline solution and $y$ liters of 25 % saline solution. This gives us the equation $0.05x + 0.25y = 0.18(x+y)$. Simplifying this equation gives us $0.1x = 0.03y$. Thus, we have $\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{0.03}{0.10} = \\frac{3}{10}$. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, we must have $x = \\frac{3}{10}y$. Since $x+y = 10$, we have $y = 10 - x$. Substituting this into $x = \\frac{3}{10}y$ gives us $x = \\frac{3}{10}(10-x)$. Solving this equation gives us $x = 3$, $y = 7$. Thus, 3 liters of 5 % saline solution and 7 liters of 25 % saline solution must be mixed together to get 10 liters of 18 % saline solution.

    "question": "A group of students went hiking in a wildlife sanctuary. During the hike a total of 180 ticks and mosquitoes were slapped. Ticks have 8 legs and mosquitoes have 6 legs. If these pests has a total of 1240 legs , how many mosquitoes and how many ticks were slapped during the hike?",
    "output": "Let's say the number of ticks slapped was x and the number of mosquitoes slapped was y. We know that 8x + 6y = 1240 and 180 = x + y\nSubtracting the second equation from the first we get 2x = 1240 - 180 = 1060\nDividing both sides by 2, we get x = 530\nSubstituting this value in the second equation, we get 530 + y = 180\nSubtracting 530 from both sides, we get y = 127\nThe answer is 127",

Multiplying both sides of this equation by 2 gives 4x = 2(y + 1) = 2y + 2. We are also told that the sum of the two numbers is -64: x + y = -64. We can substitute 4x for 2y + 2 in the equation x + y = -64 to get 4x + 2y + 2 = -64. This simplifies to 4x + 2y = -66. We can substitute 2x = y + 1 into the equation 4x + 2y = -66 to get 4(2x) + 2y = -66. This simplifies to 8x + 2y = -66. We can substitute x = -64/2 into the equation 8x + 2y = -66 to get 8(-64/2) + 2y = -66. This simplifies to -64 + 2y = -66. Adding 64 to both sides of this equation gives 2y = 2.

    "output": "Let's say a kilogram of fish costs x pesos. So 4 kg of fish would cost 4x pesos and 7 kg of fish would cost 7x pesos. Also, 2 kg of pork would cost 2x pesos and 3 kg of pork would cost 3x pesos. So, 530 pesos can buy 4x and 2x pesos of fish and pork respectively. We can write this as 4x + 2x = 530. Similarly, 875 pesos can buy 7x and 3x pesos of fish and pork respectively. We can write this as 7x + 3x = 875. Solving the first equation gives x = 23. Solving the second equation gives x = 13. Since the cost of a kilogram of fish can't be 23 and 13 at the same time, there's a mistake in the question.

The ticket sales amounted to 2876 dollars, so 4X + 6Y = 2876. Solving the first equation for Y, we get Y = 525 - X. Substituting that into the second equation, we get 4X + 6(525 - X) = 2876. Expanding the right side, we get 4X + 3150 - 6X = 2876. Adding 6X to both sides, we get 2X + 3150 = 2876 + 6X. Subtracting 2X from both sides, we get 3150 = 2876 + 4X. Subtracting 2876 from both sides, we get -283 = 4X. Dividing both sides by 4, we get -70.75 = X. So the number of student tickets sold was -70.75.

Adding the two amounts gives the total return, which is equal to 840 dollars according to the problem: 7.5 % * x + 6 % * (12000-x) = 840 dollars. Solving this equation we have 150x-60x=96000-840 dollars. Combining like terms we get 90x=96000-840, or x=1050 dollars. The amount invested in the account paying 7.5 % is 1050 dollars, and the amount invested in the account paying 6 % is 12000-1050=1150 dollars. The answer is 1050",
