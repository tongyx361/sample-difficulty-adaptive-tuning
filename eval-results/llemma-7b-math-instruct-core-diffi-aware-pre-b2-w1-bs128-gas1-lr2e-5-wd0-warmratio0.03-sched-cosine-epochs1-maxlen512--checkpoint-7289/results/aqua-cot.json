    "question": "A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 5 (\u221a3 + 1)  (B) 6 (\u221a3 + \u221a2)  (C) 7 (\u221a3 \u2013 1)  (D) 8 (\u221a3 \u2013 2)  (E) None of these",
    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question step by step.\nAngle of elevation is the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight from the observer to the object. It can be calculated as:\n\u03b8=arctan(opposite/adjacent)\nHere, as the car is being driven towards the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. It means that the position of the car has changed from being due north (or 0\u00b0) to being due west (or 90\u00b0).\nIn other words, the car has moved an angle of \u03b8=90\u221245=45 degrees.\nAlso, the distance \u2018opposite\u2019 is the height of the tower and the distance \u2018adjacent\u2019 is the distance from the car to the tower. Both are the same.\nHence, \u03b8=arctan(h/h)=45 degrees.\nOr, 45=arctan(h/h)=45\nOr, tan(45)=1\nOr, h/h=1\nHence, h=h\nGiven the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is 60\u00b0. It means the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight from the observer to the base of the tower is 60\u00b0.\nThe same is \u03b8=arctan(h/h)=60 degrees.\nOr, 60=arctan(h/h)=60\nOr, tan(60)=60\nOr, h/h=\u221a3\nOr, h=h\u221a3\nHence, the car is driven (h/k) distance more to reach the base of the tower.\ni.e. distance = h(1+\u221a3)\ntime = distance/speed\ntime = h(1+\u221a3)/speed\nIn the question, it is given that the angle of elevation has changed from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 in 10 minutes.\nHence, speed = distance/time = h(1+\u221a3)/10\nOr, speed = h(1+\u221a3)/10\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3)=10(speed)\nOr, h(1+\u221a3",

    "question": "If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 0.22 (B) 0.26 (C) 0.37 (D) 0.46 (E) 0.63",
    "output": "This would be a different question if we knew the probabilities were independent --- that is, any increase in Stock A would tell you nothing about whether or not Stock B increased, and vice versa. If the question guaranteed that, then probability P(not A *and* notB = P(notA*P(notB = (1 - 0.56)*(1 - 0.74) = (0.44)*(0.26) = 0.1156 We can't do that here, because the question does not specify that A and B are independent, but I share that because that's also a common type of question on the GMAT.\nThe best way to think about this particular question is this. Visualize a big circle: that's the space of everything that could happen with these two stocks next year, what statisticians call the \"sample space.\" That represents 100%. The \"B space\", the area of that space where Stock B increases is 74%, and the \"A space\", the area of that space where Stock A increases is 56%. The \"neither space\", the area of that space where neither Stock A nor Stock B increases, is the area of the big circle that's outside of both the A space and the B space. That's 100% - 74% - 56% = 20%. Now, for the probability question, we want to know the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. That's the same as asking what the probability is that we're in the neither space. Well, using the above logic, if the probability of something happening in the big circle is 100%, and we're subtracting out the probabilities of it happening in the A space and the B space, then the probability of it happening in the neither space is the same as the probability of it happening in the big circle, which is 20%. That 20% is the same as 0.20, so the correct answer is 0.20.",

    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nA solution of 50% means 50% milk and 50% tea. When you add milk, the percentage of milk increases. So the 50% solution is now 65% milk and 35% tea. Now repeat the process of adding milk. 35% is 10% of 65% so you are adding 10% of the new solution to the old solution. When you add the 10% of the new solution to the old solution you are adding 10% of 65% which is 6.5% to the old solution. The new solution is 71.5% milk and 28.5% tea. 71.5% is 65% + 6.5% = 71.5%.
