Next, we put the negative sign in the numerator with the fraction, making it (-12/60). We simplify this fraction, which becomes -1/5. Next, we solve the right fraction, which gives us -4/840. We simplify this fraction, which becomes -1/210. We multiply these two fractions, which gives us -1/5 * -1/210 = -1/1050. We simplify this fraction, which gives us -1/1050 = -1/1050. We multiply the numerators of both fractions, which gives us -1*-1 = 1. We multiply the denominators of both fractions, which gives us 1050*1050 = 1,050,000. We put this all together, which gives us 1/1,050,000 = 0.000001. However, this is not an answer choice, as 0.000001 is not an integer. This means that there is a mistake in the problem, as the question asks for the value of ((-12)/(-60))/((-4)/840*-6), and the answer is an integer. The mistake is in the denominator of the left fraction. Instead of multiplying the two denominators together, -60, we should have multiplied the two denominators of the left fraction together, which would have given us -48. Therefore, the correct answer is ((-12)/(-48))/((-4)/840*-6), which gives us (1/4)/((-4)/840*-6). Next, we multiply the numerator of the left fraction with the denominator of the right fraction, which gives us 1*840 = 840. We multiply the denominators of both fractions, which gives us 4*6 = 24.

    "output": "The expression 1008/(-2940)*-70 is equal to -1008/2940*70. We can simplify the fraction further: -1008/2940 = -1/294 and -1008/(-2940) = 1/294. So, the expression equals -1/294*70 = -70/294. The expression (-86)/(-2) equals 86/2. So, the overall expression equals -70/294 - 86/2 = -70/294 - 43/2. We can obtain a common denominator of 294 by multiplying the first fraction by 2/2 and the second fraction by 147/147. This yields a final answer of (-147*70)/294 - (147*43)/294 = -9640/294 - 6129/294 = -9640 - 6129 = -15769. The answer is -15769",

This is a quadratic equation and can be solved using the quadratic formula: z = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)] / (2*a), where a = -2, b = 84, and c = -882. We find that z = [84 \u00b1 sqrt((84)**2 - 4*(-2)*(-882))] / (2*-2), which simplifies to z = [84 \u00b1 sqrt(7056 - 3528)] / -4, which simplifies to z = [84 \u00b1 sqrt(3528)] / -4. The square root of 3528 is 596 and so z = [84 \u00b1 596] / -4. We throw out the solution z = 84 + 596 / -4 because the square root is positive and z = 84 - 596 / -4 because the square root is negative. Throwing out the negative solution, we find that z = 125. We now have that k(125) = 0. So f = 125. The answer is 125",

    "output": "Dividing by -8014 is the same as multiplying by -1/8014.  Fortunately, -7477062 is a multiple of 8014.  We can write $-7477062 = -8014k$ for some integer $k$.  Since there is a negative sign in the multiplication, we must have $k = -9$.  We can check that $-7477062/-8014 = 9$.  (Note that we could also have used the divisibility rule for 8014: if you add the digits of the number, you get a multiple of 8, and since 7477062 is even, it is a multiple of 8014.)  We can also check that $9 \\cdot -8014 = -7477062$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{9}$ is the answer. The answer is 9",

Adding these up, we get l(b) = 4*b**2/12 + 21*b + 14 - 7 = b**2 + 21*b + 7. So, r = l(-5) = (-5)**2 + 21*(-5) + 7 = 25 + (-105) + 7 = -83.\n\nNow, let's solve -y + 6 = -r*g + 8*g, 3*y - 5 = g. Substituting g = 3*y - 5 into -y + 6 = -r*g + 8*g, we get -y + 6 = -r*(3*y - 5) + 8*(3*y - 5) = 24*y - 40 - 5*r. So, -y + 6 = 24*y - 40 - 5*r, -25*y = -40 - 5*r, y = 40/25 + 5*r/25 = 8/5 + 5*r/25. Substituting y = 8/5 + 5*r/25 into 3*y - 5 = g, we get 3*(8/5 + 5*r/25) - 5 = g => 8 + 3*5*r/25 = g.

    "output": "Let's solve the system of equations to find the values of y and h. The first equation is 6 = -2*y + 3*h + 13. Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get -7 = -2*y + 3*h. The second equation is -3*y + 4*h = -11. Adding 3*y to both sides, we get 4*h = -11 + 3*y. Subtracting 4*h from both sides, we get -3*y = -11 - 4*h. Adding 11 to both sides, we get -3*y + 11 = -4*h. Divide both sides by -3, we get y = 4*h - 11/3.\n\nSubstituting these values into the second equation, we get z - 3 = -3*(4*h - 11/3) + (y)*i. Expanding both sides, we get z - 3 = -12*h + 44/3 + y*i. Adding 12*h - 44/3 to both sides, we get z + 12*h - 44/3 = y*i. Since the product of y and i is 12, we know either y or i is 12. Since y = 4*h - 11/3, and h is an integer, y cannot be 12. Therefore, i must equal 12. Thus, z + 12*h - 44/3 = 12, and z + 12*h = 44/3 + 12 = 100/3.\n\nAdding 12 to both sides, we get z + 12*h + 12 = 100/3 + 12 = 220/3.

We find that $3$ and $13$ are factors of $41436$, since $3\\cdot13=39$. We can also see that $41436$ is divisible by $6$, since it is an even number.\n\nWe now try to find the factors of $184068$ by looking for pairs of numbers that multiply to give $184068$. We find that $184068$ is divisible by $2$, $3$, $13$, and $6$, since it is divisible by the square of each of these numbers.\n\nThe greatest common factor of $41436$ and $184068$ is the product of all the numbers that these two numbers have in common, which is just $2\\cdot3\\cdot13\\cdot6=\\boxed{4304}$. The answer is 4304",

Solving 3*u - v = 17 for u, we get u = 17/3 + v/3. Substituting 17/3 + v/3 for u in 3*u + l = 17, we get 3*(17/3 + v/3) + l = 17. Simplifying this equation, we get 17 + v + l = 17. Subtracting 17 from both sides, we get v + l = 0.\nLet's substitute 344/10 - (-2)/(-5) for v in v + l = 0. We get 344/10 - (-2)/(-5) + l = 0.

We can divide both sides by 5, which leaves us with t = 9.\nNow we need to find the remainder when 76 is divided by 9.  We can use the rule that if m is the remainder when n is divided by d, then m = n - k*d for some integer k.  Here, 9 is the divisor, 76 is the dividend, and we want to find the remainder.  So we want to solve 76 = 9*k + m, where m is the remainder.  We can subtract 9*k from both sides, which leaves us with m = 76 - 9*k.  If k = 8, then m = 76 - 9*8 = 12.  If k = 9, then m = 76 - 9*9 = 5.  If k = 10, then m = 76 - 9*10 = -4.  If k = 11, then m = 76 - 9*11 = -13.  The smallest positive value for k is 8, which gives a remainder of 12.

Dividing both sides by 4, we have g = -1/2*c - 3.  Then we solve 2*g = 2*c - 12 for g.  Dividing both sides by 2, we have g = c - 6.  Then we have  -1/2*c - 3 = c - 6.  Adding 1/2*c + 3 to both sides, we have -1/2*c + 1/2*c + 3 = c + 1/2*c - 6.  Simplifying, we have 3 = 3/2*c - 6.  Adding 6 to both sides, we have 9 = 3/2*c.
