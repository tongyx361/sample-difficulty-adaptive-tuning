Substituting into the first equation to eliminate $c$, we find that $m = 300$.  Substituting back into the equation $c = 300 - 4m$, we find that $c = 300 - 4(300) = \\boxed{200}$.

The first plan has a 22 dollars monthly fee and charges an additional 0.13 dollars for each minute of calls. The second plan has an 8 dollars monthly fee and charges an additional 0.18 dollars for each minute of calls. For how many minutes of calls will the costs of the two plans be equal?",
    "output": "Let $x$ be the number of minutes of calls. The first plan charges $22+0.13x$ dollars, and the second plan charges $8+0.18x$ dollars. We set the two charges equal to each other and solve for $x$: \\begin{align*}\n22+0.13x&=8+0.18x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 14&=0.05x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 280&=x\n\\end{align*} So the number of minutes of calls for which the two plans will charge the same amount is $\\boxed{280}$ minutes.
