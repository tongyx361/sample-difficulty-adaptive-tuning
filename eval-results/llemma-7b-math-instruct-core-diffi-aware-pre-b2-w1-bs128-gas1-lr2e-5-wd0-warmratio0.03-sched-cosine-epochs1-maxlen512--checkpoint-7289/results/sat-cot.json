However, this method would not allow us to obtain an estimate of the proportion for each of the 50 stores.

Also, we know that the height $h$ is given by the equation $h=-16t^2+vt+k$. If we plug in $t=0$ into this equation, we get $h=k$. This tells us that $-16(0)^2+v(0)+k=k$, or $k=k$ (since $0+v(0)+k=k$).\nSo, we see that no matter what $t$ is, the height $h$ of the ball is always equal to $k$. This means that if we choose $h=k$, we should get back the initial velocity $v$. So, let's plug $h=k$ into the equation $h=-16t^2+vt+k$. We get  \\begin{align*}\nk&=-16t^2+vt+k\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-16t^2+vt\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad v&=\\frac{0}{t}\n\\\\\\Rightarrow\\qquad v&=\\boxed{0}\n\\end{align*}. The answer is 0",

We do not know the number of left-handed females, the number of left-handed males, etc. So, we have to make the table complete.\nThe number of left-handed females is x and the number of left-handed males is y. So, the number of right-handed females is 5x and the number of right-handed males is 9y. The total number of left-handed students is 18, so x + 5x = 18 and 6x = 18. The total number of right-handed students is 122, so 5x + 9y = 122 and 45x + 81y = 122.

So, the total number of right-handed students is 15 + 126 = 141. If we divide the number of right-handed students by the total number of students, we get 141/153 = 0.937.

    "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step.\nThe height of the column is $3\\frac{7}{8}$ inches = $3.875$ inches.  If 50 coins are stacked on top of each other, then the height of the column is 50 inches (since 1 cent = 1 inch).  Therefore, the height of the column is $3.875$ inches when 50 coins are stacked on top of each other.  If 50 coins are stacked on top of each other, then the number of coins is 50.  Therefore, if 3.875 inches is the height of the column, then the number of coins is $\\frac{50}{3.875}$ times the number of coins used to make a 3.875 inch column.  This is because the number of coins used to make a 3.875 inch column is $\\frac{50}{3.875}$ times the number of coins used to make a 1 inch column.  So, we have that the number of coins used to make an 8 inch column is $\\frac{50}{3.875} \\times 8$ since 8 inches is 8 times 1 inch.
