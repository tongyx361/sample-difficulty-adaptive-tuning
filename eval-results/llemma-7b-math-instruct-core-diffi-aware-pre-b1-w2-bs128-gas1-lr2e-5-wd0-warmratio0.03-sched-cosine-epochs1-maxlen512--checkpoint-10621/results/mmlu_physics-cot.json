Without the presence of the cold lake, the person's internal energy is changing at a rate of zero, but when the person falls into the lake, the rate of change of the person's internal energy begins to increase. The rate of change of the internal energy of an object is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and the surroundings.

There is a gravitational force acting downward and a normal force acting upward. The normal force is a reactive force that exactly balances the force of gravity so that the sphere does not accelerate.\nThe force of gravity is a weight and the normal force is a reaction to the weight. The normal force is not a force that is inherent to the sphere. It is a force that is derived from the interaction between the sphere and the hill.\nThe static friction force is a function of the normal force and the maximum static friction force is equal to the normal force.
