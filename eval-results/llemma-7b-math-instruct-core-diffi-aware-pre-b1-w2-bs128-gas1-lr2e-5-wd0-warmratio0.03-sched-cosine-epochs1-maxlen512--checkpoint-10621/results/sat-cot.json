(D) The show did not allow viewers enough time to respond to the poll.",
    "output": "First, we need to determine the total number of people who participated in the poll. To do this, we must add the percentages of respondents who said \"Yes\" and \"No\" together, because these two percentages are the only two ways people could have responded to the poll. We find that $28\\%+70\\%=98\\%$. This means that the total percentage of people who responded to the poll is $98\\%$, or $0.98$ of the population.\n\nNow, we must determine the percentage of people in the United States who support the new policy. We begin by assuming that the number of people who responded \"Yes\" is proportional to the number of people who support the new policy. Let $x$ be the percentage of people who support the new policy. We find that the number of people who responded \"Yes\" is $0.28x$, and the number of people who responded \"No\" is $0.70x$. We know that $0.28x+0.70x=0.98x$, which means that $x=0.98/0.98=100\\%$. This means that all people in the United States support the new policy. However, since we know that not everyone in the United States watched the show, we know that the results of the poll are not a valid representation of the sentiments of the population of the United States.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A)}}$, because the percentages do not add up to $100\\%$, and any conclusions from the poll are invalid. The answer is \\text{(A)}",
