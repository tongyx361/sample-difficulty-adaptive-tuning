He suggested that because autotrophs make their own food, they are less dependent on heterotrophs for survival than are some other organisms. Gould's hypothesis states that the evolution of oxygen would be limited by the need for heterotrophs to evolve. At first, oxygen would build up in the atmosphere, but the oxidation of reducing agents by oxygen would produce nitric oxide, which would be toxic to many organisms. Gould theorized that the first organisms to evolve would be the heterotrophs, which would be less affected by the toxic nitric oxide.",

(C) The DNA migrates only when the current is running. (D) The longer the current is running, the farther the DNA will travel.",
    "output": "DNA migrates from positive charge to negative charge. The statement is correct. The electrophoresis apparatus consists of two electrodes, one with a positive charge and another with a negative charge. As the DNA is placed in a buffer solution, it carries the buffer with it and migrates towards the electrode with the opposite charge. The smaller the DNA, the faster it will migrate since it carries less buffer with it and the electrophoretic force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the buffer. The longer the current is running, the farther the DNA will travel. This is because the electrophoretic force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the buffer and the current. Therefore, the statement that smaller DNA travels faster is correct. The DNA migrates only when the current is running. This statement is not correct. The DNA can migrate even when the current is not running. This is because the buffer solution carries the DNA and it migrates towards the electrode with the opposite charge. Hence, The answer is C.",

(D) South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe.",
    "output": "Darwin's concept of descent with modification is a combination of two ideas: a population's genetic variation and the difference in climate between continents.\nSpecies diversity declines farther from the equator. This is a direct result of the equator's greater temperature stability. The temperature difference between the equator and the poles is too great for species to evolve and diverge.\nFewer species live on islands than on the nearest continents. This is a result of the islands' lack of continental drift. The landforms on islands are shaped by the same forces that shape the landforms on the continents, but the continents have been moving for millions of years, while the islands have been moving for only a few hundred years.\nBirds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance.

If there is no land within their flying range, they will not be found.\nSouth American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe.
