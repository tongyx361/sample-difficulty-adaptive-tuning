Adding 27 to both sides gives us 13*d + 17 = 2464*d + 27, and subtracting 13*d from both sides gives us 17 = 2447*d + 27.  Finally, subtracting 27 from both sides gives us 17 - 27 = 2447*d, so that -10 = 2447*d.  Since d is negative, we can divide both sides by 2447 to get -10/2447 = d.

This simplifies to 5*(136 - 2*x) + 308 = 5*(136 - 2*x) + 143 + 165. Subtracting 5*(136 - 2*x) from both sides, we get 308 = 143 + 165 - 2*x. Adding 2*x to both sides, we get 308 + 2*x = 143 + 165.

Since $999999999 = 1000000000 - 1$, we have $253468392 = (1000000000 - 1) \\cdot (1000000000 + 1) \\cdot (1076543211)$. Note that $1000000000 - 1 = 1000000000 - 1000000001 + 1000000001 - 1 = 1000000001 - 1$, so $253468392 = (1000000001 - 1) \\cdot (1000000001 + 1) \\cdot (1076543211)$.

So, taking the square root of $253468392$ is the same as taking the square root of the difference of the two squares, which is the difference of the square roots of the two squares. This means that $\\sqrt{253468392} = \\sqrt{1000000001} - \\sqrt{1076543211}$. Since $1000000001 = 1000000000 + 1$, we have $\\sqrt{1000000001} = 1000000000 + 1$, and since $1076543211 = 1000000000 - 7654321$, we have $\\sqrt{1076543211} = 1000000000 - 7654321$.

    "output": "First, we need to find the value of d. We start by simplifying the fraction 4/6. 4/6 = 2/3, so we can rewrite the fraction as 2/3 * -6/2.

Finally, we can rewrite the entire expression as -8/3 * -88/11, which equals 64/11. Since this is the value of d, we can substitute 64/11 for d in the expression for q. q then equals a(64/11). We can simplify this expression by substituting u for 64/11. u*-u**2 + 3*u + 2 equals u*(-u**2 + 3 + 2/u). Since u is positive, we can rewrite the expression as u*(-u**2 + 3 + 2*u**-1). This simplifies to u*(-u**2 + 3 + 2*u**-1 + 0). The terms -u**2 and 0 do not affect the remainder when u is divided by 11, so we can ignore them. 3 + 2*u**-1 then equals 3 + 2*11**-1, which equals 3 + 2/11.

Substituting j = -6 into r(u), we find r(-6) = -(-6)**2 - 6*(-6) - 4 = -36 + 36 - 4 = -4. Now we can divide -4 by -3 to find the value of u: -4/(-3) = 4/3.

Solving for h, we get h = (-2*l - 7)/6. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 3*l = -(-2*l - 7)/6 - 8. Multiplying through by 6, we get 18*l = -2*l - 7 - 48.

Combining like terms, we get x = (2*m - m + 1/3)/3. Cancelling out the 3, we get x = 2*m - m + 1/3, which means x = m + 1/3. Therefore, m = x - 1/3. Substituting x into the equation x = -m + 2*m + 1/3, we get x = -(-m + 2*m + 1/3) + 1/3. Expanding the right hand side, we get x = m + 2*m + 1/3 + 1/3. Combining like terms, we get x = 3*m + 2/3. Therefore, 3*m = x - 2/3, so m = (x - 2/3)/3. Substituting x into the equation m = (x - 2/3)/3, we get m = (11 - 2/3 - 2/3)/3. This simplifies to m = 8/3, so m = 8/3. The answer is 8/3",

    "output": "First, we need to figure out what b is. We start by simplifying the numerator of the fraction inside the brackets, which is (20/8)/((-2)/(-4)). We can simplify 20/8 by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2, which gives us 10/4. Next, we can simplify the fraction ((-2)/(-4)) by dividing the numerator and denominator by -2, which gives us (1/-2). So, (10/4)/(1/-2) equals 5/2. This gives us b=5/2.\nNow, we substitute 5/2 back into the equation 4*r - 11 - b = 0. We can simplify 4*r - 11 - 5/2 to 4*r - 11 - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to -11 gives us -10. So, we have 4*r - 11 - 1/2 = -10. Adding 11 to -10 gives us -1. So, we have 4*r - 1/2 = -1.\nWe can then multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction. This gives us 8*r = -2. Dividing both sides by 8 gives us r = -1/4. The units digit of -1/4 is 4, so The answer is 4",
