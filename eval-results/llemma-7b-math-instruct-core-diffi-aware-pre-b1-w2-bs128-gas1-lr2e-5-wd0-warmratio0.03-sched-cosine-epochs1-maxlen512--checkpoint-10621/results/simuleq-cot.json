    "output": "Let S be the number of solid rolls sold and P be the number of print rolls sold. We know that S + P = 480 and 4S + 6P = 2340.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4S + 6(480 - S) = 2340\nThis simplifies to 2S = 2340 - 2880\nSo, 2S = -540 and S = -270\nSince S is the number of solid rolls sold, a negative number means that the company sold more print rolls than solid rolls. This is impossible, so there must be an error in the problem. Going back to the original equations, we see that if we multiply the second equation by 2, we get 8S + 12P = 4680.\nSubtracting the first equation from this equation, we get 4S + 6P = 2340\nThis simplifies to 2S + 3P = 1170\nTrying 1170 - 3P for S, we get 2(1170 - 3P) + 3P = 1170\nThis simplifies to 2P = 0\nSo, P = 0 and S = 1170.\nSince the number of rolls sold is 480, the number of solid rolls sold is 1170 and the number of print rolls sold is 0.\nThe answer is 1170",

    "question": "Each unit of grain A contains 2 grams of fat and 80 calories , and unit B has 3 grams of fat and 60 calories. If the final product is to provide 18 grams of fat and 480 calories , how much of grain A and how much of grain B should be used. ",
    "output": "Let x be the number of units of grain A and y be the number of units of grain B. We know that 2x + 3y = 18 and 80x + 60y = 480. Solving the first equation for y, we get y = 6 - 2x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 80x + 60(6 - 2x) = 480. Solving for x, we get x = 1.5. Substituting this into y = 6 - 2x, we get y = 3. Now, we just need to scale up to find the number of units of grain A and grain B to use. Since 1 unit of grain A has 2 grams of fat and 1 unit of grain B has 3 grams of fat, we need to use 1.5 units of grain A and 3 units of grain B to get 18 grams of fat. Similarly, since 1 unit of grain A has 80 calories and 1 unit of grain B has 60 calories, we need to use 1.5 units of grain A and 3 units of grain B to get 480 calories. The answer is 1.5",

Therefore, the interest payment on the first loan is (x*2.4)/100, and the interest payment on the second loan is (y*4.7)/100. The total interest payment is 14,761.81 dollars. Therefore, we can form the equation: (x*2.4)/100 + (y*4.7)/100 = 14,761.81. Substituting y=318,338-x, we can form the quadratic equation: (x*2.4)/100 + (318,338-x*4.7)/100 = 14,761.81.

We can list all the pairs of integers that satisfy this equation:\n\n(4, 6) (6, 3) (8, 2) (10, 1) (12, 0)\n\nThe last pair doesn't work because we are given that there are 15 animals, and 12 ducks would mean there are only 3 goats. The first three pairs do satisfy the condition that there are 15 animals.\n\nWe now just need to choose one of the first three pairs. Either one will work, but we need to make sure that we have 15 animals. In the first pair, we have $g=10$ and $d=1$, so 10 goats and 1 duck will work.

How many distinct permutations of this multiset are there?\n\nI would be tempted to use the formula $n!$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the set, and get $8!$. However, this overcounts the number of distinct permutations, since the three $c$'s are not distinct, and the three $b$'s are not distinct.\n\nThe answer is $8!$, but I'm not sure why. Can someone explain?\n\n-\n\nThere is only one way to arrange the letters $a,b,c$. The problem is that you are counting each possible way to arrange the $b$s and $c$s separately. To see why, suppose that you only have two $b$s and two $c$s. You would count the first arrangement of the $b$s and $c$s as one permutation, but you would also count the second arrangement as a separate permutation.\nTo see why this is wrong, imagine that you have three distinct objects $x,y,z$. You would not count the arrangement $xyz$ twice, even though you can rotate it two ways. The same is true for permutations of multisets.\nSo, to count the number of distinct permutations, you just need to count the number of ways to arrange the $a$s, $b$s, and $c$s. There are $8!$ ways to arrange them, as you suspected.\nYou're right. The answer is indeed $8!$. Your logic is also correct. If you have $3$ distinct objects $x,y,z$, the number of permutations will be $3!$. In this case, however, you have $3!$ different 'groups' of $3$ elements which are identical. So, to account for this, you multiply $3!$ by $3!$, which is the number of ways you can arrange the $3!$ groups. So, in this case, the answer would be $3! \\cdot 3! = 3!^2 = 8$. \u2013\u00a0 barak manos Dec 17 '14 at 11:11\nIn this case, the answer is indeed $8!$, but the logic is wrong. You're double-counting the rotations of the $b$s and $c$s, so you need to divide by $3!$ and $3!$, which cancels out the overcounting. \u2013\u00a0 barak manos Dec 17 '14 at 11:14\n@barakmanos: I don't think that's right.

The total amount of salt is 0.05x + 0.25y = 0.18(x + y) = 1.8 liters.  Therefore, 0.05x + 0.25y = 1.8.  Multiplying both sides by 20, we get 10x + 5y = 36.  Then, 10x + 5y = 36 and x + y = 10.

Let z be the price per pound of the mixture. We know that x*3.75 + y*2.75 = 40*z. We want to find z. We can multiply the first equation, x + y = 40, by 3.75 to get 3.75x + 3.75y = 150. We can multiply the second equation, x*3.75 + y*2.75 = 40*z, by 2.75 to get 2.75x + 3.75y = 112.5. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to get 0.25x = 37.5. We can divide both sides of this equation by 0.25 to get x = 15. We can subtract x from the first equation to get y = 25. We can plug x and y into the equation z = (x*3.75 + y*2.75) / 40 to get z = (15*3.75 + 25*2.75) / 40 = 3.00 dollars per pound. The answer is 3",

    "output": "Let s be the number of student tickets sold and g be the number of general admission tickets sold. We know that s + g = 525 and 4s + 6g = 2876. Solving for s in the first equation gives s = 525 - g. Substituting that into the second equation gives 4(525 - g) + 6g = 2876. Simplifying this equation gives 2100 - 4g + 6g = 2876. Adding 4g to both sides gives 2100 + 2g = 2876. Subtracting 2100 from both sides gives 2g = 776. Dividing both sides by 2 gives g = 388. Substituting this value back into the equation s = 525 - g gives s = 525 - 388 = 137. The answer is 137",

If there were 148 tires that needed to be replaced to due to damage , how many cars and trucks were involved in the incident? ",
    "output": "Let's assume that there are 2 cars with 4 wheels each, and 2 trucks with 6 wheels each. We know that the total number of wheels should be 148, so 2 cars with 4 wheels each will have 2*4=8 wheels. 2 trucks with 6 wheels each will have 2*6=12 wheels. The total number of wheels for these 4 vehicles is 12+8=20, and this is only 20 out of the total number of wheels that need to be replaced. There must be 148-20=128 wheels that need to be replaced by other vehicles. This means that there are 128/4=32 vehicles with 4 wheels. If there were 2 cars with 4 wheels each, this means that there are 2+32=34 vehicles.
