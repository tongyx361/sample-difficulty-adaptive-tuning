We know that a + b = 800 and that 14.50a + 22.00b = 16640.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 14.50a + 22.00(800 - a) = 16640\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 14.50a + 17600 - 22.00a = 16640\nSubtracting 17600 from both sides, we get -5.50a = -10040\nDividing both sides by -5.50, we get a = 184\nThe answer is 184",

    "output": "Let's assume the number of 20 dollar tickets was x and the number of 30 dollar tickets was y. Since the total revenue was 191,000 dollars, we get the equation 20x + 30y = 191,000. We also know that the total number of tickets sold was 7400, so we get the equation x + y = 7400. We can solve for x in the second equation to get x = 7400 - y. We substitute x into the first equation to get 20(7400 - y) + 30y = 191,000. This simplifies to 148,000 - 20y + 30y = 191,000. Simplifying this equation gives 10y = 43,000. Dividing both sides by 10 gives y = 4300. Since y represents the number of 30 dollar tickets sold, there were 4300 tickets sold for 30 dollars. The answer is 4300",

This is because the ball rolls on the gravel surface whereas it only slides on the asphalt surface. The ball rolls faster on the gravel surface because it has a greater moment of inertia. The greater moment of inertia is due to the ball having more mass. The ball has the same mass on both surfaces, so the greater moment of inertia must be due to the shape of the ball.
