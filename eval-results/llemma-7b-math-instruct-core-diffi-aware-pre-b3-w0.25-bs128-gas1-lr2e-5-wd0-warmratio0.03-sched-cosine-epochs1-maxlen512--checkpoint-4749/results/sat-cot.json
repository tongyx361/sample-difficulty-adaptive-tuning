We are not asking for the probability that 78 percent of all adults in the city are satisfied with the quality of air in the city, but rather the probability that 78 percent of 1000 adults selected at random from a large city will be satisfied with the quality of air in that city.Let\u2019s think about each of the statements.I. Of all adults in the city, 78 percent are satisfied with the quality of air in the city. This is a statement about all adults in the city, not just those who were surveyed. Since the survey was designed to be random, it is assumed that the sample of adults who were surveyed is representative of the population of all adults in the city. Because the sample is representative, the population parameter, which is the percentage of all adults in the city who are satisfied with the quality of air, can be estimated with the sample proportion, which is the percentage of the sample who are satisfied with the quality of air. Therefore, this statement is true.II. If another 1,000 adults selected at random from the city were surveyed, 78 percent of them would report they are satisfied with the quality of air in the city. This is also true and is essentially the same as statement I. The survey was designed to be random, and so we can assume that the sample is representative.

If 1,000 adults selected at random from a different city were surveyed, 78 percent of them would report they are satisfied with the quality of air in the city. This is not necessarily true.
