    "output": "First, we begin by solving the system of equations. We are given that 14 = 3*a - 4*t and -5*a + 30 = 5*t - 5. We can see that by adding the two equations, we get -2*a + 5*t = 20. Adding 2*a - 5*t to both sides, we get -5*t = 20 - 2*a. Adding 5*t to both sides, we get 5*t = 20 + 2*a. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get 14 = 3*a - 4*(20 + 2*a)/5.

    "output": "To solve for k, we begin by adding c to both sides of the first equation, which gives us -10 = 4*k + 2*c. Then, we subtract 4*k from each side, which gives us -10 - 4*k = 2*c. Next, we add 3*c to both sides of the second equation, which gives us 2*c + 17 = -k - 3 + 3*c. Then, we subtract 17 from each side, which gives us 2*c - 17 = -k - 3 - 17. We can then combine like terms, which gives us 2*c - 22 = -k - 20. We then add k to both sides, which gives us 2*c - 22 + k = -20 + k. We then add 22 to both sides, which gives us 2*c + k = 2. We then divide both sides by 2, which gives us c + k = 1. We then subtract c from both sides, which gives us k = 1 - c.\n\nNow, we substitute 1 - c into the second equation for k, which gives us 2*(1 - c) - 17 = -(1 - c) - 3 - 17. Then, we simplify, which gives us 2 - 2*c - 17 = -1 - c - 3 - 17. This simplifies to -2*c - 16 = -1 - c - 20. We then add 2*c to both sides, which gives us -16 + 2*c = -20 + 2*c. This simplifies to 2*c - 16 = -20 + 2*c, which gives us 2*c - 2*c = -20 - 16. This simplifies to 0 = -36, which is not possible. Therefore, there are no solutions to the system of equations, so k is not defined. However, since the question asks for the nearest to k in 2/23, -5, -1/2, we can see that the correct answer is -5, since -5 < -36. The answer is -5",

Moving the v terms to the left side, we get -3uv + v = 11v, which simplifies to -3uv = -10v. Dividing both sides by -10, we get u = v/3, which is the same as v = 3u. Substituting this into the first equation, we get -2*z - 5*(v/3) + 16 = -v/3. Cancelling a factor of 3, we get -2*z - 5v/3 + 16 = -v/3, which simplifies to -2*z - 2v + 16 = -v. Moving the v terms to the left side, we get -2z - 16 = -3v, which simplifies to 2z + 16 = 3v. Dividing both sides by 4, we get z = 4v - 4.

    "output": "We first solve the first equation for c by subtracting 2c from both sides, which leaves us with -51i = 252 + 63 + c. Then, we add 51i to both sides, which gives us 252 + 63 + c = 51i. This gives us c = 252 + 63 + c - 51i. Simplifying, we get c = 252 + 63 - 51i. Therefore, the first equation is c = 252 + 63 - 51i. Next, we solve for c in the second equation by subtracting -5c - 5i - 45 from the equation. This gives us -10c = 5i + 45. Dividing both sides by -10, we get c = -(5i + 45)/10, which simplifies to c = -5i/2 - 4.5. Since these two equations are equal to c, we set them equal to each other, which gives us -4.5 - 63 = -5i/2 - 4.5. Solving for i, we get i = 12. Plugging this into the first equation, we get c = 252 + 63 - 51(12), which simplifies to c = 252 + 63 - 612. Therefore, c = -453. The answer is -453",

    "output": "Let's solve the first equation first: u = -2*w - 5. We can substitute u for -2*w - 5 into the second equation -5*u = 4*w + 1 - 0. This gives us -5*( -2*w - 5) = 4*w + 1 - 0. Solving this equation gives 10*w + 25 = 4*w + 1 - 0. This simplifies to 6*w + 24 = 1 - 0. This simplifies further to 6*w + 25 = 1. Subtracting 25 from both sides gives 6*w = -24. Dividing both sides by 6 eliminates the 6 from the left side and gives w = -4. Substituting -4 back into u = -2*w - 5 gives u = -2*(-4) - 5 = 3. Substituting 3 and -4 into v(z) = 15*z - 19*z + z**2 - r + 1 gives v(5) = 15*5 - 19*5 + 5**2 - r + 1 = 75 - 95 + 25 - r + 1 = 14 - r. Since -7 + 10 = u*r, -7 + 10 = 3*r. This gives us r = 3. Substituting this value back into v(5) = 14 - r gives v(5) = 14 - 3 = 11.\nThe answer is 11",

Then, dividing both sides by 4, we get f = 3/4*z + 15/4.\n\nSince 3*f = -9 - z, we have 3/4*z + 15/4 = -9 - z.  Then, subtracting 3/4*z from both sides, we get 15/4 = -9 - z - 3/4*z = -9 - 7/4*z.

    "question": "What is the fourth root of 3273 to the nearest integer?",
    "output": "We can have a fairly close estimate of $\\sqrt[4]{3273}$ by using the fact that $3273$ is between $3241=111^4$ and $3424=112^4$, so $\\sqrt[4]{3273}$ is close to $112$.  We can refine our estimate by trying $111^4=12343$ and $112^4=12544$.  Since $3273$ is between $12343$ and $12544$, $\\sqrt[4]{3273}$ is closer to $\\boxed{112}$ than to $111$. The answer is 112",
