    "output": "Let's say that stan invested x at 18% and (17000-x) at 4%. The interest rate for the 18% is 18%*x. The interest rate for the 4% is 4%*(17000-x). The total interest is the sum of the two interest rates which is 0.18x+0.04(17000-x). The total interest is given as 1380. We can write the equation 0.18x+0.04(17000-x)=1380 and solve for x. 0.18x+680-0.04x=1380\n0.14x=700\nx=4714.2857142857\nx=4714\nSo, stan invested 4714 dollars at 18%.

    "output": "Let w be the maximum ideal waist size and h be the hip size. Since w is directly proportional to h, we can write w = ah + b where a and b are constants. We know that w = 32 when h = 40. Substituting these values, we get 32 = a(40) + b. Therefore, 32 = 40a + b and 40a + b = 32. Subtracting 40a from both sides, we get b = -8. Therefore, the equation becomes w = ah + (-8). We also know that w = 35 when h = 35. Substituting these values, we get 35 = a(35) + (-8). Therefore, 35 = 35a - 8 and 35a - 8 = 35. Adding 8 to both sides, we get 35a = 43. Dividing both sides by 35, we get a = 1.2. Substituting these values back into w = ah + (-8), we get w = (1.2)(h) - 8. We know that the maximum ideal waist size for a woman with 35 inch hips is less than 35, so we can set w = 35 and solve for h. Substituting w = 35 into w = (1.2)(h) - 8, we get 35 = (1.2)(h) - 8. Adding 8 to both sides, we get 43 = (1.2)(h). Dividing both sides by 1.2, we get h = 35. Therefore, the maximum ideal waist size for a woman with 35 inch hips is 35 inches. The answer is 35",

We know that the total number of goats and chicken's legs is 30 and the total number of goats and chicken's heads is 13. So, we can write the equation 2x + 2y = 30 and x + y = 13. We will first find the value of y from the second equation. Subtracting y from both sides of the second equation, we get x + y - y = 13 - y. So, x = 13 - y. Substituting the value of x into the first equation, we get 2(13 - y) + 2y = 30. This simplifies to 26 - 2y + 2y = 30. The left side is equal to 26, so the right side must also be equal to 26. Thus, 30 - 2y = 26. Subtracting 26 from both sides, we get -2y = -4. Dividing both sides by -2, we get y = 2. So, the number of chicken is 2.

We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:\n20x + 30y = 1,600\nWe can solve for x, which is the number of advance tickets sold:\n20x + 30y = 1,600\n20x = 1,600 - 30y\nx = 80 - 3/2y\nSubstituting this into the first equation, we get:\n(80 - 3/2y) + 30y = 1,600\n80 + 15y = 1,600\n15y = 800\ny = 53.33\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for x, we get:\nx = 80 - 3/2(53.33) = 53.33\nThe number of advance tickets sold is 53, and the number of same-day tickets sold is 53.33, which is not a whole number. Therefore, there was likely an error somewhere in the calculations, as the number of tickets sold must be whole numbers.\nOne possible solution is that there were 56 advance tickets sold, and 53 same-day tickets were sold, for a total of 119 tickets sold, which is a possible solution for the system of equations.\nThe answer is 56",

The flight from Atlanta to Paris takes 8 hours going East, so the distance covered is $4000\\cdot 8 = 32000$ miles. The plane's average speed is $x+y$, so the total distance can be expressed as $32000=x+y$. The flight from Atlanta to Paris also takes 10 hours going West, so the distance covered is $4000\\cdot 10 = 40000$ miles. The plane's average speed is $x-y$, so the total distance can be expressed as $40000=x-y$. We now have a system of two equations, which we can solve as follows: \\begin{align*}\n32000&=x+y\\\\\n40000&=x-y\n\\end{align*} Adding the two equations, we get $72000=2x$, so $x=3600$.

We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:\n38x + 61y = 791.50\n54x + 50y = 923\nWe can multiply the first equation by 54 and the second equation by 38 to make the coefficients of x and y match:\n54x + 300y = 3905.40\n38x + 190y = 791.50\nNow we can subtract the second equation from the first and solve for y:\n(54x + 300y) - (38x + 190y) = 3905.40 - 791.50\n(54x - 38x) + (300y - 190y) = 3113.90\n16x + 110y = 3113.90\nNow we can divide both sides of the equation by 110 to find the value of y:\n16x + 110y = 3113.90\n16x + 110y = 3113.90\n16x + 110y = 273.90\n16x = 273.90 - 110y\nx = 1.75 - .65y\nSince x = 1.75 - .65y, we can substitute 1.75 - .65y for x into 38x + 61y = 791.50 to solve for y:\n(38 * (1.75 - .65y)) + 61y = 791.50\n61.5 - 21.75y + 61y = 791.50\n61.5 - 2.75y = 791.50\n-2.75y = -791.50 - 61.5\n-2.75y = -853\ny = 320.25\nSince y = 320.25, we can substitute 320.25 for y into 1.75 - .65y = x to solve for x:\n1.75 - .65(320.25) = x\n1.75 - 216.75 = x\nx = -215\nThe price of each bath towel is $1.75 and the price of each washcloth is $320.25.\nThe answer is 175",

    "output": "Let a be the number of liters of the 32 % solution and b be the number of liters of the 12 % solution. We know that a + b = 50.\nWe need to find an equation where we can solve for a and b.\nThe key is that both solutions have to be mixed to make 50 liters of the 20 % solution.  So, we need to find an equation that has a and b in the numerator and the denominator.\nWe are given that the solution with 32 % sodium has 32 liters of sodium and that the solution with 12 % sodium has 12 liters of sodium.\nThe sum of the sodium in the 32 % solution and the 12 % solution is 32 + 12 = 44 liters.\nThe total solution is 50 liters, so there is 50 - 44 = 6 liters of sodium in the 20 % solution that is not from the 32 % or 12 % solution.\nTherefore, there is 6/50 = 60 % sodium in the 20 % solution that is not from the 32 % or 12 % solution.\nThis means that the 32 % and 12 % solutions are 40 % and 20 % sodium, respectively.\nThus, we can write the equation:\n\\begin{align*}\na + b &= 50 \\\\\n(32/100)a + (12/100)b &= (20/100)(50) \\\\\n32a + 12b &= 1000 \\\\\n8a + 3b &= 250 \\\\\n8(a/b) &= (250 - 3b)/b \\\\\n8(a/b) &= 25/b - 3 \\\\\n8a &= 25b - 3b \\\\\n8a &= 22b \\\\\n\\end{align*}The only possible values of a and b are a = 11 and b = 19 or a = 22 and b = 11.\nThus, the chemist should use 11 liters of the 32 % solution and 19 liters of the 12 % solution to produce 50 liters of the solution that is 20 % sodium.\nThe answer is 11",

    "output": "Let $x$ be the number of square centimeters of 20% pure acid needed and let $y$ be the number of square centimeters of 60% pure acid needed. Since all the square centimeters of pure acid added total to 80, we have the equation $x+y=80$. The 20% pure acid solution must be mixed with the 60% pure acid solution to form the 45% pure acid solution.  Since the amount of pure acid in the 45% solution is equal to 45% of the total volume of the solution, we have the equation \\begin{align*}\n.2x+.6y&=.45(x+y)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad .2x+.6y&=.45x+.45y\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad .15y&=.25x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=\\frac{.25}{.15}x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=1.67x\n\\end{align*}\n\nSubstituting into the first equation, we have $x+1.67x=80$, so $2.67x=80$ and $x=30.9$.  Substituting into the second equation, we have $y=1.67(30.9)=53.46$.  So the chemist needs $30.9$ square centimeters of 20% pure acid and $53.46$ square centimeters of 60% pure acid.\n\nNote: In the above work we assumed that the pure acid solutions were mixed in a 1:1 ratio. If we do not wish to make this assumption then we can let $a$ represent the number of square centimeters of 20% pure acid used and $b$ represent the number of square centimeters of 60% pure acid used. We now have two equations, $a+b=80$ and $.2a+.6b=.45a+.45b$, which must be solved simultaneously. However, this is a simple case of substitution, so we will spare the details.  We find $a=30.9$ and $b=53.46$. The answer is 30.9,53.46",

The total interest earned for one year is 3360, so we have the equation: 18/100 * x + 14/100 * (22000 - x) = 3360. This equation simplifies to 18x + 288000 - 14x = 336000.

    "question": "A plane flying with a tail wind flew at a speed of 460 miles per hour , relative to the ground. When flying against the tailwind , it flew at a speed of 310 miles per hour. Find the speed of the tailwind. ",
    "output": "Let's call the speed of the tail wind x. This means that the speed of the plane relative to the air is 460-x. We know that the speed of the plane relative to the ground is the sum of these two, which is 310. This means that the speed of the plane relative to the ground is 310=460-x+x. Solving for x, we find that the speed of the tailwind is x=150. The answer is 150",

    "question": "At Al 's Rent-a-Center , it costs 30 dollars more per month to rent a leather couch than it does to rent a microfiber couch. Pauline rented a leather couch for 8 months and then exchanged it for a microfiber couch , which she rented for 12 months. She paid a total of 1620 dollars to rent these couches. Solve this system of equations to find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch , in dollars. Find the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch. ",
    "output": "Let L be the monthly rental charge for the leather couch and let M be the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch.\nWe know that L = M + 30 and that LM = 1620.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get (M + 30)M = 1620.\nThis simplifies to M^2 + 30M - 1620 = 0.\nDividing by M^2, we get 1 + 30/M - 1620/M^2 = 0.\nThen we can write 1620/M^2 = 30/M = 15/M.\nSo we have 1 + 15/M - 1620/M^2 = 0.\nWe can solve this equation for M by multiplying both sides by M^2, collecting like terms, and bringing the M^2 terms to the other side to get:\nM^3 + 15M^2 - 1620 = 0\nWe can now use synthetic division to find that the cube of M plus 15 times the square of M minus 1620 is equal to 0.\nThe possible values of M are 15, -12, and -15.\nSince a monthly rental charge cannot be negative, the rental charge for the microfiber couch is 15 dollars.\nSubstituting this value into the first equation, we get L = 15 + 30 = 45 dollars.\nThe answer is 45",
