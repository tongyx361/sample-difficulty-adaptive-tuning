I want to know the number of distinct permutations of $S$ that contain $k$ cycles. For example, if $S = \\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3\\}$, there are $3$ distinct permutations that have $2$ cycles: $(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)$, $(1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2)$, and $(2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1)$.\n\nI know there are $n^r$ different ways to arrange a multiset of $r$ elements, and I know how to calculate the number of ways to rearrange the elements of a given cycle, but I'm having trouble putting these two facts together.\n\n-\n\nThe number of ways to arrange a multiset is indeed $n^r$.\nLet's look at the specific example you gave. We have $n=3$ and $r=2$. We have $3^2=9$ ways to place the 1's, $3^2=9$ ways to place the 2's, and $3^2=9$ ways to place the 3's. However, we must divide by $2^2=4$ for overcounting, because you can have the 1's in either of the two places, and similarly for the 2's and 3's.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\frac{9\\cdot 9\\cdot 9}{4\\cdot 4}=2025$, which is the second highest answer.\nIn general, for $k$ cycles, you have $n^r/k^2$ ways, where $r$ is the number of elements in the multiset and $k$ is the number of cycles. For example, for $4$ cycles, you have $2^2=4$ ways to place the elements in each cycle. # How to calculate the number of permutations of a multiset with a given number of cycles?\n\nLet's say I have a multiset $S$ of $n$ elements. I want to know how many distinct permutations of $S$ there are that have exactly $k$ cycles. For example, if $S = \\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3\\}$, there are $3$ distinct permutations with $2$ cycles: $(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)$, $(1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2)$, and $(2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1)$.\n\nI'm looking for a formula that will calculate this for any multiset $S$ and any integer $k$.\n\n-\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{n!}{k!}$ if $n \\ge k \\ge 1$ and $n$ is a nonnegative integer.\nThe reasoning is as follows: For the $k$ cycles, each element of $S$ is in a cycle, and there are $\\dfrac{n!}{k!}$ ways to arrange the $n$ elements in the $k$ cycles. For the remaining $n-k$ elements, there are $k!$ cycles, and they can be arranged in $(n-k)!$ ways. So the answer is $\\dfrac{n!}{k!}$.\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{n!}{k!}$ if $n \\ge k \\ge 1$ and $n$ is a nonnegative integer. \u2013\u00a0 user236182 Nov 19 '15 at 17:36 # How to calculate the number of permutations of a multiset with a given number of cycles?\n\nLet's say I have a multiset $S$ of $n$ elements.

For example, if $S = \\{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3\\}$, one permutation of $S$ with $3$ cycles is $(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)$, and another one with $2$ cycles is $(1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2)$.\n\nI know there are $n!$ ways to arrange the elements of $S$ in total, but I'm only interested in the arrangements that have $k$ cycles. Is there a way to calculate this?\n\n\u2022 I don't think there's a closed-form expression for this. You could calculate it recursively, though. \u2013\u00a0ShreevatsaR Apr 2 '14 at 17:17\n\nLet $C_n^k$ denote the number of permutations of the multiset $S$ that have exactly $k$ cycles. Observe that if all the elements of $S$ are distinct, then $C_n^k=0$ for $k>n$, so in what follows we may assume that $n\\geq k$.\nIf $n=k$, then $C_n^k=1$.\nIf $n>k$, then to form a permutation of $S$ with $k$ cycles, we can pick $k$ different elements of $S$ in $\\binom{n}{k}$ ways, then distribute the remaining $n-k$ elements of $S$ arbitrarily among those $k$ elements, in $k^{n-k}$ ways. The total number of permutations is then $$C_n^k=\\binom{n}{k}k^{n-k}=\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}k^{n-k}=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}k^{n-k}.$$\nThis gives us the following recurrence relation: $$C_n^k= \\begin{cases} 1, & n=k \\\\ \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}k^{n-k}, & n>k \\end{cases}$$\nWe can compute the first few values of $C_n^k$ as follows: \\begin{align*}\nC_n^1 &= \\frac{n!}{(n-1)!",

    "output": "Let's call the smaller number $x$. Since the sum of two numbers is 48, the larger number is $48-x$. The difference between three times the smaller number and the larger number is 16, so $3x-(48-x)=16$. This simplifies to $4x-48=16$, which adds 48 to both sides and simplifies to $4x=64$, which divides both sides by 4 and simplifies to $x=16$. The answer is 16",

The average price of each douglas fir is 300 dollars , so the total price of the douglas fir trees is 300*F dollars. The average price of each ponderosa pine is 250 dollars , so the total price of the ponderosa pine trees is 250*P dollars. The total price of the trees is 217,500 dollars, so 300*F + 250*P = 217,500.\nThe number of douglas fir trees is F and the number of ponderosa pine trees is P, so the total number of trees is F+P. We know that 217,500 = 300*F + 250*P = 6000*F + 500*P, and we also know that the total number of trees is F+P. If we substitute the second equation into the first, we get 6000*F + 500*P = 217,500.\nDividing both sides by 1000, we get 6F + 5P = 2175.\nThe answer is 615",

    "output": "Let S be the price of a senior citizen ticket.\nSo, 4 senior citizen tickets + 3 student tickets = 79 dollars.\nAnd, 12 senior citizen tickets + 10 student tickets = 246 dollars.\nThus, 4 senior citizen tickets + 3 student tickets = 12 senior citizen tickets + 10 student tickets.\nTherefore, 12 senior citizen tickets - 4 senior citizen tickets = 10 student tickets - 3 student tickets.\nSo, 8 senior citizen tickets = 7 student tickets.\nAnd, 8 senior citizen tickets / 8 = $1.\nThe answer is 1",

    "output": "Let's say x is the amount of money invested at 10%. The amount of money invested at 8% is (5000-x). The interest rate for the amount invested at 10% is 10%*x. The interest rate for the amount invested at 8% is 8%*(5000-x). The total interest is 460 dollars. This can be expressed as the equation 10%*x + 8%*(5000-x) = 460. Simplifying this equation gives x*(10/100) + (5000-x)*(8/100) = 460. This simplifies to 10x + 40000 - 8x = 46000. Combining like terms gives -2x = -34000.

    "output": "The reaction involves the isomerization of CH4 and Br2 to form CH3Br and HBr. The reaction is first order with respect to CH4 and Br2 and second order with respect to CH3Br and HBr. Therefore the reaction is given by the following rate law: rate = k [CH4] [Br2] - k' [CH3Br] [HBr]\rwhere k and k' are rate constants. The rate of the reaction can be expressed in terms of the disappearance of CH4 or Br2 and the appearance of CH3Br or HBr.\rrate = -d[CH4]/dt = -d[Br2]/dt = +d[CH3Br]/dt = +d[HBr]/dt\rThis gives the following three equations: -d[CH4]/dt = -d[Br2]/dt = +d[CH3Br]/dt = +d[HBr]/dt\rSolving these equations gives the following differential equations: d[CH4]/dt = - d[Br2]/2dt = d[CH3Br]/dt = d[HBr]/2dt\rThe first two equations can be combined to give d[CH4]/dt = - d[Br2]/2dt = d[CH3Br]/dt = d[HBr]/2dt\rThis can be solved for [CH4] which gives [CH4] = -2[Br2] + 2[CH3Br]\rThe rate constant k can be found by setting [CH4] equal to 1M (since it is the initial concentration of CH4) and [Br2] equal to 3M (since it is the initial concentration of Br2) and [CH3Br] equal to 0 (since no CH3Br is formed initially) and [HBr] equal to 0 (since no HBr is formed initially). This gives the equation 1 = -2(3) + 2[CH3Br] which has a solution of [CH3Br] = 5\rTherefore the rate constant k = 1/5\rThe rate constant k' can be found by setting [CH3Br] equal to 3 (since it is the initial concentration of CH3Br) and [HBr] equal to 0 (since no HBr is formed initially). This gives the equation 3 = k' (1) (3) which has a solution of k' = 1/3\rTherefore the rate constant k' = 1/3\rThe rate of the reaction can be found by setting [CH4] = 1 (since it is the initial concentration of CH4) and [Br2] = 3 (since it is the initial concentration of Br2). This gives the equation -1 = -(3/2) + (3/2) [CH3Br] which has a solution of [CH3Br] = 1\rTherefore the rate of the reaction = 1/5 * 1 * 3 - 1/3 * 1 = 1\rSince the reaction is first order with respect to CH4 and Br2 and second order with respect to CH3Br and HBr, the rate of the reaction is given by -k [CH4] [Br2] + k' [CH3Br] [HBr]\rSubstituting the rate constants and concentrations gives the rate of the reaction = -1/5 * 1 * 3 + 1/3 * 1 = 1\rThe answer is 1",

Therefore, there are 40/154 = 2.75 Ca atoms per CaI2 molecule and 127/154 = 0.85 I atoms per CaI2 molecule. The mass of a mole of Ca is 40 g, and the mass of a mole of I is 127. Therefore, the mass of a mole of CaI2 is 40 + 127 = 167 g. The mass of 2.75 Ca atoms is (2.75)(40) = 110 g. The mass of 0.85 I atoms is (0.85)(127) = 110 g.
