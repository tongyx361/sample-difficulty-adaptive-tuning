If a population of algae-eaters experiences predation pressure from pike-cichlids, which of the following should least likely be observed in the algae-eater population over the course of many generations?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters (B) Selection for nocturnal algae-eaters (active only at night) (C) Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young (D) Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes",
    "output": "This is a tricky one, because the answer choices all seem to have some sort of logic behind them. Let's go through them one by one.\nA. Selection for drab coloration of the algae-eaters. This might seem counter-intuitive, but it's actually quite logical. If the predator (pike-cichlid) has drab coloration, it will be harder for the prey (a.k.a. algae-eater) to spot it. So, this would lead to the production of drab-colored algae-eaters, which is what the answer is asking for. It makes total sense, but it's not what WILL happen over the course of many generations. We're looking for something that is least likely to happen, so this is not the answer.\nB. Selection for nocturnal algae-eaters (active only at night). This would be a huge detriment to the algae-eater population. If there were nocturnal algae-eaters, then the predator would be able to prey on them at night, while they were asleep. As a result, we would expect to see fewer, and smaller, algae-eaters. This is NOT what we want to happen.\nC. Selection for larger female algae-eaters, bearing broods composed of more, and larger, young. This would result in the production of larger females, which is good. Larger females will have more offspring, which is also good. So, this is exactly what we would expect to see over the course of many generations.\nD. Selection for algae-eaters that become sexually mature at smaller overall body sizes. This would result in the production of smaller individuals, but does that necessarily mean that we would expect to see more, and larger, individuals over the course of many generations? It's not necessarily so. The size of the mature individual has little to do with the size of the offspring.\nThe answer is C",

Parasitism: One organism benefits at the expense of the other. For example, consider the tree frog and the leafhopper. The leafhopper parasitizes the tree frog, taking food from the frog's mouth while the frog is asleep. Both the frog and the leafhopper benefit from this relationship.\nB.

The bacteria live in the intestine and eat the bacteria and other organisms that live there, thus receiving nutrients from the intestine. In return, the bacteria help defend the intestine from pathogens.\nC. Natural selection: One species of organism becomes more common than other species that are less well adapted to the environment. For example, the tree frog and the leafhopper are very similar, but the leafhopper is much more common. This is because the tree frog is less well adapted to the environment and is therefore less likely to survive.\nD.

This is an example of mimicry, but it's a form of Batesian mimicry. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic looks exactly like the real thing, distracting the predator with its similarity. The toad is fooled because the millipede looks like the toad, not because the millipede is toxic.\nB. A moth exhibits false eyes at its tail end in order to disorient predators. This is also an example of mimicry, but it's a form of M\u00fcllerian mimicry. In M\u00fcllerian mimicry, the mimic looks like something else, confusing the predator. The moth is not fooled by the false eyes, but rather by the similarity to other insects.\nC. A moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee. This is not an example of mimicry.
