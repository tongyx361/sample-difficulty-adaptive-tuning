We need to determine the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain.\nWe can first write the rate of the liquid passing through the drain as (w/25) gallons/x seconds. We can then set up a proportion to determine the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain. Let t = the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain. This is a proportion of gallons/time to gallons/time. We can now set up the following proportion:\nw/25/x = y/t\nt = yx/w\nThe answer is E.",
