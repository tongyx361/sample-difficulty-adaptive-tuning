    "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step.\nSince the ball is launched vertically upward from the ground, the equation is modeled by a parabola. The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line that passes through its vertex. The maximum value of $h$ occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is 25 seconds. The maximum value of $h$ is then 25 meters. Since the ball is launched vertically upward from the ground, the height of the ball $t$ seconds after it is launched is given by $h = 25 - 4.9t^2$. The equation $h = 0$ is the equation of the height of the ball when it hits the ground. Solving the equation $25 - 4.9t^2 = 0$, we find $t = \\pm 2.5$. The positive value is the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground, which is $t = \\boxed{2.5}$.\n\nAlternatively, the equation $h = 0$ can be rewritten as $4.9t^2 = 25$. Rearranging, we get $t^2 = \\frac{25}{4.9}$, so $t = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{4.9}} = \\pm \\frac{5}{7}$. The positive value is the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground, which is $t = \\boxed{2.5}$.\n\nNote that the above quadratic is not a perfect square, so the vertex of the parabola is not an integer. To obtain an integer value for the time, we can rewrite the quadratic as $h = 25 - 5t^2$. The equation $h = 0$ is the equation of the height of the ball when it hits the ground. Solving the equation $25 - 5t^2 = 0$, we find $t = \\pm 2$. The positive value is the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground, which is $t = \\boxed{2}$.\nThe answer is 2",

    "output": "Earth has an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $\\frac{m}{s^2}$.\nUsing the formula $W=mg$, we can calculate the weight of a 1 kg object on each planet by multiplying the mass in kg by the acceleration due to gravity.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Mercury is 3.6 N.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Venus is 8.9 N.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Earth is 9.8 N.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Mars is 3.8 N.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Jupiter is 26 N.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Saturn is 11.1 N.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Uranus is 10.7 N.\nThe weight of a 1 kg object on Neptune is 14.1 N.\nFor the weight of the object to be 170 N, we need to be on either Uranus or Neptune.\nSince the question asks for the planet with the least weight, we choose the lesser of the two, Uranus.\nThe answer is B.",

    "output": "Let's examine each answer choice:\n(A) The percentages do not add up to $100 \\%$, so any possible conclusions from the poll are invalid. This is true, and the \"addition\" of percentages is a quick way to check for this. However, the invalidity of the results is due to the percentages not representing the full population, not due to a mathematical requirement. (In other words, $28 \\%$ of a different population might add up to $100 \\%$.)\n(B) Those who responded to the poll were not a random sample of the population of the United States. It's true that the sample was biased, but this does not invalidate the results. The biased sample is a subset of the full population, and bias only means that the sample is not representative of the population, not that the sample is invalid.\n(C) There were not $50 \\%$ \"Yes\" responses and $50 \\%$ \"No\" responses. It's true that the results do not represent a $50-50$ split, but this is due to the percentages not representing the full population, not due to a mathematical requirement. (In other words, $50 \\%$ of a different population might not add up to $100 \\%$.)\n(D) The show did not allow viewers enough time to respond to the poll. The time limit is not relevant to the representativeness of the sample. For example, if there is a $50-50$ split in the population, then a biased sample that included only $75 \\%$ of the population would still be a valid sample.\nThe answer is B.",
