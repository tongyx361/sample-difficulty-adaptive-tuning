    "output": "The one-time fixed costs will be 35,630 dollars, and the variable costs will be 11.50 dollars per book, so the total cost per book will be 35,630 + 11.50 = 35,745 dollars.\nThe publisher will sell the finished product to bookstores at a price of 20.25 dollars per book, so the total amount obtained from the sales will be 20.25 * x = 20.25x dollars, where x is the number of books.\nThe production costs will equal the money obtained from sales when 35,745 = 20.25x, so x = 35,745/20.25 = 1787 books.\nThe answer is 1787",

The total amount of money from selling the mixture is  \\begin{align*}\n2x+3(80-x)&=80+2x-3x \\\\\n&=80-x.\n\\end{align*}  The value of the mixture, $80-x$, must be 2.20 times the total amount of candy, $80+2x-3x=80-x$.  Thus, \\[\n80-x=2.20(80-x).\n\\]  Expanding, we get $80-x=172-2.20x$.  Subtracting $80-x$ from both sides, we get $0=172-2.20x-80+x$.  Simplifying, we get $82=0.20x$, so $x=\\frac{82}{0.20}=\\boxed{410}$ pounds.  The dealer should use 410 pounds of the cheaper candy and 40 pounds of the more expensive candy. The answer is 410",

    "question": "A department store held a sale to sell all of the 214 winter jackets that remained after the season ended. Until noon , each jacket in the store was priced at 31.95 dollars. At noon , the price of the jackets was further reduced to 18.95 dollars. After the last jacket was sold , the total receipts for the clearance sale were 5108.30 dollars. How many jackets were sold before noon and how many jackets were sold after noon? ",

We know that S + N = 214 and S \u00d7 31.95 + N \u00d7 18.95 = 5108.30.\nMultiplying the first equation by 31.95 and the second equation by 18.95 and subtracting them, we get:\n31.95 S - 18.95 N = 5108.30 - 214(31.95) = 5108.30 - 6491.30 = -1383.00\nSolving for N, we get:\nN = -1383.00 / -18.95 = 74\nSo, 74 jackets were sold after noon.
