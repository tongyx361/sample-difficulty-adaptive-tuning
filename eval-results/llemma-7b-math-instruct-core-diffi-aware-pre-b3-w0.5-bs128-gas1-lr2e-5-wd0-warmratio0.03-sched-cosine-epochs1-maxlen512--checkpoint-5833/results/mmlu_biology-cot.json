Darwin famously proposed that evolution is driven by natural selection, in which individuals best adapted to their environments are most likely to survive and reproduce.

None of these processes is synonymous with evolution, per se. However, they are all critical to understanding the process of evolution.\nThe answer is D",

(B) A particular cell dies when it is no longer needed by the organism. (C) A cell carries out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated. (D) Plant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense measure in cells that have been infected by parasites.",
    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nApoptosis is a highly regulated process in multicellular organisms. It occurs in response to signals from outside the cell (such as signals from other cells in the organism), or from within the cell (such as signals from the cell itself). Thus, it is not random, but is instead regulated in response to signals that are either external or internal to the cell. Therefore, the statement that apoptosis is random is not correct.\nA cell can die when it is no longer needed by the organism only if it is not needed for the survival of the organism. Such a cell would be a waste, and would be eliminated by the process of natural selection. Therefore, this statement is correct.\nA cell can carry out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated only if the mutations are harmful. Such mutations can lead to cancer, in which the cell grows out of control and may eventually die. Therefore, this statement is also correct.\nPlant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense measure in cells that have been infected by parasites. Parasites are organisms that live in or on another organism and make it suffer. In plants, parasites include fungi and bacteria that cause diseases such as rust and blight.

In other words, the system is regulated in such a way that any change in the variable will cause a change in the other variable that works to restore the system to its original state. In the given options, option C is an example of positive feedback. The statement says that when ATP is abundant the rate of glycolysis decreases. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvic acids and other products. If there is more ATP available then the rate of glycolysis will be lower.

    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nR-strategists are those species that have high reproductive rate per individual, and low number of offspring per individual. For example, if an animal has 100 eggs, and each egg hatches into an adult, then the number of adults per individual is 100/100=1. In this case, the reproductive rate per individual is high, and since the number of offspring is low, this is an r-strategist.\nSmall body size: An r-strategist may have a small body size, but this is not always the case. For example, humans, which have a very high reproductive rate per individual (100 offspring), do not have a small body size.\nOccupancy of unstable environments: This is not typical of r-strategists. The r-strategist may be a specialist or generalist, but the niche is relatively stable. For example, a lion is an r-strategist that occupies a very unstable niche, since the niche is constantly changing due to the mobility of the lion.\nHigh competitive ability: This is typical of r-strategists.
