Visualize a big circle: that's the space of everything that could happen with these two stocks next year, what statisticians call the \"sample space.\" That represents 100%. The \"B space\", the area of that space where Stock B increases is 74% of that space, so only 26% is outside the \"B space\". We don't know the relationship of Stock A & Stock B, but we'd like to know where to put Stock A on the diagram to maximize the area that's outside of both the \"A space\" and the \"B space.\" Well, with just the \"B space\" in the big circle, already 74% is taken up, and only 26% is free. If any of the \"A space\" is outside of the \"B space\", then it will eat up some of that free 26%. The only way to maximize that free space, to keep all 26% of the space outside of both \"A\" and \"B\", is if all of the \"A space\" is outside of the \"B space.\" In other words, the area that we want to maximize is the area that's outside of both the \"A space\" and the \"B space\", and that area is 100% - 74% - 56% = 20%.\nThe answer is E",

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000?\nA. 5/7\nB. 3/5\nC. 4/7\nD. 2/5\nE. 2/7\nSince 1,000=2^3*5^3 then a number can be relatively prime to 1,000 if and only if it does not have 2 and/or 5 as a factor.\nOut of 1,000 integers 560 numbers have 2 as a factor and 99 numbers have 5 as a factor. Notice that 2*5=10 and 5*2=10 too, so if a number has both 2 and 5 as a factor then it has 10 as a factor too.\nSo, out of 1,000 integers 560+99=659 numbers have 10 as a factor and 1,000-659=341 numbers do not have 10 as a factor. Thus, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 341/1,000=17/50.\nThe answer is E.",
