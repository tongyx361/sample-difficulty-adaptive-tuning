When m = 26, we have -d = m - 17, which becomes -d = 26 - 17 = 9, so d = -9.  Since the problem asks for a solution in the form of an integer, we can discard the solution d = -9.

Dividing both sides by -3 yields c = -105 - 17*i.\n\nSubstituting this value for c into the second equation yields -5*(-105 - 17*i) - 5*i - 45 = 0, which simplifies to 525 + 85*i - 5*i - 45 = 0.

    "output": "First, we notice that c(b) = -6*b**2 + b + 96 is a parabola whose zeros are at b = -4 and b = 6 (these zeros come from the quadratic formula).\n\nSince a(w) = -2*c(w) - 11*p(w), we can see that a(w) will be zero whenever w is a zero of c(w) or p(w).  Therefore, a(w) will be zero at w = -4, w = 6, and w = 0.\n\nSince a(w) = -2*c(w) - 11*p(w), we can also see that a(w) will be symmetric about the origin.  This means that if w = 4, then a(w) = a(-w), and if w = -6, then a(w) = a(-w).\n\nNow, let's evaluate a(w) at w = 4, w = 6, and w = 0:\n\na(4) = -2*c(4) - 11*p(4) = -2*(-6*4**2 + 4 + 96) - 11*(4**2 - 19) = 96 - 28 = 68\n\na(6) = -2*c(6) - 11*p(6) = -2*(-6*6**2 + 6 + 96) - 11*(6**2 - 19) = 48 - 132 = -84\n\na(0) = -2*c(0) - 11*p(0) = -2*(-6*0**2 + 0 + 96) - 11*(0**2 - 19) = 174\n\nFrom this, we can see that a(w) = 68 when w = 4 and a(w) = -84 when w = 6.  Also, a(w) is a quadratic, and we know that it opens downward (since the coefficient of w**2 is negative).  Therefore, a(w) will be greater than 0 when w is between 4 and 6, and a(w) will be less than 0 when w is less than 4 or greater than 6.\n\nThis tells us that a(w) = 68 when w = 4 and a(w) = -84 when w = 6, and since a(w) is a quadratic and we know that it opens downward, we can conclude that a(w) will be greater than 0 when w is between 4 and 6, and a(w) will be less than 0 when w is less than 4 or greater than 6.\n\nAlso, we know that a(w) = -2*c(w) - 11*p(w), and we know that c(w) = -6*w**2 + w + 96 and p(w) = w**2 - 19.  Therefore,\n\na(w) = -2*c(w) - 11*p(w) = -2(-6*w**2 + w + 96) - 11(w**2 - 19) = 12*w**2 - 38*w + 192\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is 38**2 - 4*12*192 = 1484 - 864 = 620.  Since the coefficient of w**2 in a(w) is positive, the parabola a(w) opens upward.  Furthermore, the leading coefficient of a(w) is 12, which means that a(w) will have a minimum value of 12*0**2 - 38*0 + 192 = 192.\n\nSince a(w) will be greater than 0 when w is between 4 and 6, and a(w) will be less than 0 when w is less than 4 or greater than 6, the value of a(w) will be 192 for some w between 4 and 6, and a(w) will be greater than 192 for all w less than 4 or greater than 6.\n\nNow, we are given that f + 206 = 7*m.  We know that f = a(-16), and we know that a(-16) will be greater than 0, since -16 is between 4 and 6.  Furthermore, we know that a(w) will be greater than 192 for all w less than 4 or greater than 6, so m must be less than 206/7 = 30.\n\nThe prime factors of 206 are 2, 11, and 19.  Since m is less than 30, and the prime factors of 206 are 2, 11, and 19, the only possible prime factors of m are 2 and 11.  Therefore, m must be divisible by 2 and by 11, and the only number that is divisible by both 2 and 11 is 22 = 2*11.\n\nIf m = 22, then f + 206 = 7*m = 7*22 = 154, and f = a(-16) = 192 (since a(w) will be greater than 192 for all w less than 4 or greater than 6).  Therefore, m = 22, and the prime factors of m are 2 and 11.  The answer is 2",

We do not know the value of the thousands digit, so we must find it first. We have the digits 2465212. The first three digits, 246, are the thousands, hundreds, and tens digits, respectively. The remaining digits, 5212, are the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands digits, respectively. The digits 5212 add up to 15, which is the value of the thousands digit. Now, we must find the value of the ten thousands digit. The ten thousands digit is ten times the thousands digit. Since the thousands digit is 5, the ten thousands digit is 10*5 = 50.
