We can plug in C = 40 - P into this expression to get P = 460 - 55(40 - P) / 42.5. All of the arithmetic results in P = 110 / 17.5, which means P = 6.

Substituting this value in for $x$ in the second equation, we get that $85 - y = 64$, which means that $y = 21$. Thus, the two numbers are $x = 85$ and $y = 21$, so our answer is $\\boxed{(85,21)}$.

    "output": "Let's say the daily fee is $x and the mileage fee is $y.\nBarney was charged 69 dollars for 3 days and 300 miles, so 3x + 300y = 69.\nMary was charged 123 dollars for 5 days and 600 miles, so 5x + 600y = 123.\nIf we multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3, we get 15x + 1500y = 345\nand 15x + 1800y = 369.\nIf we subtract the second equation from the first, we get 123y = 25, so y = 25/123 = 1/5.\nSubstituting y = 1/5 into 3x + 300y = 69 gives 3x + 60 = 69, so 3x = 69 - 60 = 9, and x = 3.\nThe daily fee is $3 and the mileage charge is $1/5.\nThe answer is 3",

These two equations are then:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0.15x+0.25y&=0.18(x+y)\\\\\nx+y&=100\n\\end{align*}To solve for $x$ and $y$, we can first multiply the second equation by 0.15 and subtract it from the first equation to get $0.01y=0.03x$.  Dividing by 0.01, we get $y=3x$, so $x=\\frac{y}{3}$.  Substituting this into the second equation to solve for $y$, we get $\\frac{y}{3}+y=100$, so $y=300$.

    "output": "Let x be the number of gallons of 100 percent antifreeze needed.\nThe total number of gallons of winter mixture will be 55 - x, because the 55 gallon drum has already been filled with 20 percent winter mixture.\nSince the percent of antifreeze in the winter mixture is 20, the total amount of antifreeze in the winter mixture will be 20/100 * 55 - x = 11 - x.\nSince the percent of antifreeze in the 100 percent antifreeze solution is 100, the total amount of antifreeze in the 100 percent antifreeze solution will be 100/100 * x = x.\nSince the percent of antifreeze in the 10 percent antifreeze mixture is 10, the total amount of antifreeze in the 10 percent antifreeze mixture will be 10/100 * 55 = 5.5.\nThe total amount of antifreeze in the winter mixture and the 100 percent antifreeze solution will be x + 11 - x = 11 - x.\nThe total amount of antifreeze in the winter mixture, the 100 percent antifreeze solution, and the 10 percent antifreeze mixture will be 11 - x + x + 5.5 = 16.5.\nThus, we have the equation 16.5 = 11 - x + x + 5.5, which simplifies to 16.5 = 11 + 5.5.\nTherefore, x = 11 - 16.5 = -5.5 gallons.\nThe answer is 5",

    "output": "Let x be the rate of the first storm and y be the rate of the second storm. We can set up the following system of equations:\nx + y = 55\n20x + 40y = 1800\nSolving for x in the first equation, we get x = 55 - y.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get 20(55 - y) + 40y = 1800.\nThis simplifies to 1100 - 20y + 40y = 1800.\nSo, 20y = 700, and y = 35.\nSubstituting this value back into the first equation, we get x = 55 - 35 = 20.\nThe answer is 20",

    "output": "Let x be the number of dimes she has. Let y be the number of nickels she has. x+y=33 because the number of dimes plus the number of nickels equals the total number of coins. The value of the dimes is x*10 cents and the value of the nickels is y*5 cents. The total value is 235 cents. The equation is x*10+y*5=235. Multiplying through the parentheses we get 10x+5y=235. Combining like terms we get 5x+5y=235. Dividing both sides by 5 we get x+y=47. This is the same as the equation x+y=33. Therefore, she has 47 nickels and 3 dimes. The answer is 47",

This means that x + y = 207.\nThe total worth of the nickels and dimes is 17.55 dollars. This means that 5x + 10y = 1755.\nWe can subtract 5x from both sides of the second equation to get 10y = 1755 - 5x.\nWe can substitute y = 207 - x into this equation to get 10(207 - x) = 1755 - 5x.\nThis simplifies to 2070 - 10x = 1755 - 5x.\nAdding 5x to both sides of this equation simplifies it to 2070 = 1755.\nThis is a contradiction, so there are no solutions to the system of equations.\nThis means that the child does not have any dimes, and therefore no nickels.\nThe answer is no nickels",

    "output": "Let P be the amount of peanuts and C be the amount of cashews.\nP + C = 60 pounds.\nThe value of P = 2.40 dollars/pound * P = 2.40P dollars.\nThe value of C = 6.00 dollars/pound * C = 6.00C dollars.\nThe total value of the mixture = 3.00 dollars/pound * 60 pounds = 180 dollars.\nThus, 2.40P + 6.00C = 180 dollars.\nThus, 2.40P = 180 - 6.00C dollars.\nThus, P = 180 - 6.00C / 2.40 = 75 - 2.40C.\nThus, C = (180 - 75) / 2.40 = 225/2.40 = 100 pounds.\nAnd P = 60 - 100 = 40 pounds.\nThe answer is 40",

    "output": "Let $w$ be the number of units of whole wheat flour needed, and let $m$ be the number of units of whole milk needed. We can set up the following system of equations:  \\begin{align*}\n13.6w + 3.4m &= 75 \\\\\n2.5w + 3.7m &= 15\n\\end{align*} To solve for $w$ and $m$, we can use Cramer's rule, which states that the ratio of the determinants of certain matrices is equal to the value of the corresponding variable in the solution to the system of equations. We first calculate the determinants: \\begin{align*}\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 13.6 & 3.4 \\\\ 2.5 & 3.7 \\end{pmatrix} &= (13.6)(3.7) - (3.4)(2.5) = 50.82 - 8.5 = 42.32 \\\\\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 13.6 & 3.4 \\\\ 2.5 & 15 \\end{pmatrix} &= (13.6)(15) - (3.4)(2.5) = 204 - 8.5 = 195.5 \\\\\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 75 & 3.4 \\\\ 15 & 3.7 \\end{pmatrix} &= (75)(3.7) - (3.4)(15) = 292.5 - 51 = 241.5\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the ratio of the determinants is $241.5 : 195.5 : 42.32$, which simplifies to $11 : 9 : 2$.
