From the problem it follows that $75B + 40L = 19,250$ and $B + L = 350$. If we add the two equations, we get $115B + 40L = 19,600$, which simplifies to $23B + L = 3,800$. From the last equation, we get $L = 3800 - 23B$. We can now substitute $L$ in the first equation, so we have to solve $75B + 40(3800 - 23B) = 19,250$, which simplifies to $B = 250$. From the problem we know that $B + L = 350$, so $L = 350 - 250 = 100$. The answer is $\\boxed{(250,100)}$. The answer is (250,100)",

Which of the following could define the function $h$ ? \nAnswer Choices: (A) $h(x)=-3(d)^{x}$ (B) $h(x)=3(x) d$ (C) $h(x)=d(-x)^{3}$ (D) $h(x)=d(3)^{x}$",
    "output": "The $y$-intercept of the graph of the exponential function $h$ is the point at which the value of $h$ is $d$. Therefore, $h(0) = d$. The function $h(x) = d(-x)^3$ has $h(0) = d$, so the graph of $h$ is a reflection of the graph of $f(x) = d^x$ about the $y$-axis. However, the graph of $h$ passes through the point $(0,d)$, which is not a reflection of the point $(0,d)$ about the $y$-axis. Therefore, $h(x) = d(-x)^3$ cannot define the function $h$. Similarly, the function $h(x) = -3(d)^x$ has $h(0) = -d$, so the graph of $h$ is a reflection of the graph of $f(x) = d^x$ about the $y$-axis. However, the graph of $h$ passes through the point $(0,-d)$, which is not a reflection of the point $(0,d)$ about the $y$-axis. Therefore, $h(x) = -3(d)^x$ cannot define the function $h$.

The horse with the lowest reported weight was found to actually weigh 10 pounds less than its reported weight. What value remains unchanged if the four values are reported using the corrected weight? \nAnswer Choices: (A) Mean (B) Median (C) Range (D) Standard deviation",
    "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step.\nMean: 15 horses, so the weighted average of the 15 horses is the same before and after the change.\nMedian: The median is the weight of the horse that is the \u201cmiddle\u201d in the ordered list of the 15 horses. Since at least one of the horses weighs 10 pounds more than its reported weight, and at least one weighs 10 pounds less, the median will decrease by 10 pounds.\nRange: The range is the difference between the minimum and maximum weights. Since the minimum weight decreases by 10 pounds, and the maximum weight increases by 10 pounds, the range increases by 20 pounds.\nStandard Deviation: The standard deviation is related to the distance that each weight is from the mean. Since these distances do not change, the standard deviation does not change.\nThe answer is A",
