    "output": "Let's first find h. We start by simplifying the fraction ((-8)/(-3)). Since the numerator and denominator have a common factor of -8, we can simplify this to 8/3. Next, we need to simplify the fraction ((-10)/(-15)). Again, the numerator and denominator have a common factor of -5, so we can simplify this to 2/3. Now, we multiply these two fractions together. 8/3 * 2/3 = 16/9. We can simplify this fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 3, which gives us 16/3. Now, we have to subtract this fraction from -4. -4 - 16/3 = -20/3. This is not a whole number, so we cannot simplify it any further. Therefore, h = -20/3.\nWe now know that w = -2. So, we need to solve the equation -2*y + (-20/3)*s = -39. First, we need to distribute the negative sign through the parentheses, so we get -2*y - 20/3*s = -39. To solve this equation, we first need to get rid of the fraction in the second term. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, giving us -6*y - 20*s = -117. We then move the term -20*s to the right side of the equation, giving us -6*y = -117 - 20*s. We can now divide both sides by -6, to get y = 117/6 + 10*s. The prime factors of 117 are 3 and 39. The prime factors of 60 are 2, 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, the prime factors of y are 3, 39, and 5. The answer is 3,39,5",

We can then compare $-6244\\frac{0}{1}$ to $-1\\frac{1}{1}$, and find that $-6244\\frac{0}{1} < -1\\frac{1}{1}$.  We then convert $-1\\frac{1}{1}$ to a decimal and find that $-1\\frac{1}{1}$ is equal to $-1.5$.  We then compare $-1.5$ to $2/23$, and find that $-1.5 > 2/23$.

    "output": "First, we need to solve for j and t. We begin by adding 5*t to both sides of the first equation, which gives us -65 + 5*t = 5*j. Next, we add 3*t to both sides of the second equation, which gives us 3*t = 2*j - 6. We can substitute 2*j - 6 for 3*t in the first equation, which gives us -65 + 5*t = 5*(2*j - 6). Solving this equation for t, we find t = 20. Substituting 20 for t in the second equation gives us 3*t = 2*j - 6, which simplifies to 2*j = 6 + 60. Solving for j, we find j = 21.\nNow that we have the values for j and t, we can find n(6): n(6) = -6 - 21 - 12 + 7 + 3*6**2 = -35 + 108 = 73. The tens digit of 73 is 7. The answer is 7",

Dividing both sides by -2, we find a = -16.\nWe now substitute -16 back into the equation f(l) = 17 - 17*l. We get f(l) = 17 - 17*l, so the derivative of f(l) with respect to l is -17.\nWe now substitute -16 back into the equation s(b) = 26*b - 26. We get s(b) = 26*b - 26, so the derivative of s(b) with respect to b is 26.\nSince g(o) = a*f(o) - 5*s(o), we have g(o) = -16*f(o) - 5*s(o).

    "output": "First, we need to perform the operations inside the parentheses. Since the parentheses are grouped together, we perform the operation of adding the terms together.  -8 + -14 = -22 and -22 + 30 = 8.  Now, we have 2 + 16 - 8.  Next, we perform the subtraction, 16 - 8 = 8.  Finally, we add 2 + 8 = 10.  Therefore, the value of 2 + 16 - (-8 + -14 + 30) is $\\boxed{10}$. The answer is 10",

    "question": "What is the eighth root of 1228 to the nearest integer?",
    "output": "We have \\[1228 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13^1.\\] Since $13^1 > 8$, the eighth root of 1228 is between $3$ and $4$. Since $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 < 1228$, the eighth root of 1228 is less than $4$. Therefore, the eighth root of 1228 is $\\boxed{3}$. The answer is 3",
