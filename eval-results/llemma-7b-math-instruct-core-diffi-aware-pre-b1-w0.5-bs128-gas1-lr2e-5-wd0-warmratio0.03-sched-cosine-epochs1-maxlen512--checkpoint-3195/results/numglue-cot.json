The total value of the dimes and nickels is $3.10 so we have the equation n*$.10 + m*$.05 = $3.10. We can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to get 10n + m = $31. We can subtract 5m from both sides to get 10n = 31-5m. We can distribute on the right side to get 10n = 31-5m = 10+26-5m = 10-5m+26. We can add 5m to both sides to get 10n + 5m = 10 + 26. We can subtract 10 from both sides to get 5m + 10n = 26. We can divide both sides by 5 to get m + 2n = 5.2.\nIf we let n be the number of dimes then we have n+2n = 5.2 which means 3n = 5.2 which means n = 1.733333.\nThe number of dimes is 1.733333 but that doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a dime.

We then find the number of atoms of O in 1 mol of AlPO4, which is 4, by dividing the molar mass of AlPO4 by the molar mass of O. Next, we multiply the number of atoms of O in 1 mol of AlPO4 by the number of grams of O in 1 mol of AlPO4, which is 15.9994, to find the total number of grams of O in 1 mol of AlPO4. We then multiply the number of grams of O in 1 mol of AlPO4 by the number of moles in 100 g of AlPO4 to find the total number of grams of O in 100 g of AlPO4. Finally, we divide the total number of grams of O in 100 g of AlPO4 by the total number of grams in 100 g of AlPO4, which is 270.106, to find the mass percentage of O in 100 g of AlPO4.
