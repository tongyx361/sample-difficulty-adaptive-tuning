This simplifies to: 0.01x = 600 - 550 = 50, so x = 50/0.01 = 5000 dollars. Substituting x = 5000 into x + y = 15000 gives: 5000 + y = 15000, so y = 10000 dollars. Therefore, the investor should invest 5000 dollars at 4% and 10000 dollars at 3%. The answer is 5000",

    "output": "Let X be the amount invested at 18 %. Then 17000 - X is the amount invested at 4 %. The interest rate for 18 % is 18 / 100 * X dollars and for 4 % is 4 / 100 * (17000 - X) dollars. The total interest is the sum of these two quantities. Therefore 1380 = 18 X / 100 + 4 (17000 - X) / 100 Solve for X. X = 9 * 1000. The amount invested at 18 % is 9 * 1000 dollars, the amount invested at 4 % is 17000 - 9 * 1000 = 8 * 1000 dollars. The answer is 9000",

Notice that the first equation is linear, while the second equation is linear in $m$ and $n$. This means we can solve for $m$ in terms of $n$ using the second equation as follows: \\begin{align*}\n0.25m + 0.50n &= 0.4(30) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 0.25m &= 0.4(30) - 0.50n \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad m &= 1.6 - 0.4n\n\\end{align*} Substituting this expression for $m$ into the first equation, we get \\begin{align*}\n1.6 - 0.4n + n &= 30 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 1.6 + 0.6n &= 30 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad 0.6n &= 14 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\qquad n &= 21.6666...\n\\end{align*} Since $n$ must be an integer, we can see that $n = 21$. Substituting this value into our expression for $m$, we get $m = 1.6 - 0.4(21) = 1.6 - 8.4 = 6.6$.

    "output": "Let X be the amount invested at 8.5 %. Therefore, 8000 - X is the amount invested at 6.4 %. The total annual income is equal to 575 dollars. Thus, the interest earned on X at 8.5 % per annum is (X * 8.5 * 1)/100. Similarly, the interest earned on 8000 - X at 6.4 % per annum is (8000 - X * 6.4 * 1)/100. Therefore, (X * 8.5 * 1)/100 + (8000 - X * 6.4 * 1)/100 = 575. This simplifies to 8.5X + 52800 - 6.4X = 57500. Therefore, 2.1X = 3000. Thus, X = 1500. Therefore, the amount invested in the first investment is 1500 dollars, and the amount invested in the second investment is 8000 - 1500 = 6500 dollars. The answer is 1500",

    "output": "Let X be the number of adults and Y be the number of children. We know that X + Y = 200 and 3X + 1.5Y = 510. Multiplying the first equation by 3 gives us 3X + 3Y = 600. Subtracting the second equation from this gives us 2Y = 110. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us Y = 55. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get X + 55 = 200. Subtracting 55 from both sides gives X = 145. So there were 145 adults and 55 children in the theater. The answer is 145",

We can turn this into a system of two equations: \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 10 \\\\\n0.05x + 0.25y &= 1.8 \\\\\n\\end{align*} The first equation represents the total amount of solution, and the second equation represents the total amount of salt in the solution. We can solve for $x$ and $y$ to get $x = 6$ and $y = 4$. Thus, 6 liters of 5% saline solution and 4 liters of 25% saline solution must be mixed together to get 10 liters of 18% saline solution.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 5x + 330 - 10x = 235. Solving this equation for x, we get x = 12. Substituting this value back into y = 33 - x, we get y = 21. Therefore, Trinidad has 12 nickels and 21 dimes. The answer is 12",

    "output": "Let $x$ and $y$ be the number of liters of 50% and 80% solutions that we mix, respectively. We can use the following equation to represent the fact that we are mixing two solutions to get a 70% solution: $0.5x + 0.8y = 10.5$. Multiplying both sides by 10, we get $5x+8y=105$, so $x + 16y = 21$. Now, we want $x+y$ to be 10.5, so $16y = 21 - 10.5 = 10.5$, or $y = 10.5/16 = 0.6875$. Since $x+y=10.5$, we have $x = 10.5 - 0.6875 = 9.8125$. Thus, we should mix 9.8125 and 0.6875 liters of the 50% and 80% solutions, respectively.\n\nAlternatively, we can refer to the problem as choosing $x$ and $y$ so that $0.5x + 0.8y = 10.5$. We can solve this equation for $y$ to get $y = \\frac{10.5 - 0.5x}{0.8}$. We know that $x+y=10.5$, so we have $x + \\frac{10.5 - 0.5x}{0.8} = 10.5$. Multiplying both sides by 8, we get $8x + 10.5 - 0.5x = 84$, so $7x + 10.5 = 84$, which gives $x = 11$. Then, $y = \\frac{10.5 - 0.5\\cdot 11}{0.8} = \\frac{0.5}{0.8} = 6/8 = 3/4$, which means that we should mix 11 and 3/4 liters of the 50% and 80% solutions, respectively. The answer is 9.8125",

The interest rate for the 10 % investment is 10/100 x, while the interest rate for the 8 % investment is 8/100 (5000 - x). The total interest is represented by the equation 10/100 x + 8/100 (5000 - x) = 460. By simplifying the equation, we get 18000 - 180x = 46000.

The second equation is $0.05x + 0.10y = 0.09(x+y)$, since the $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ solutions must be mixed to make the $9\\%$ solution. Solving for $x$ and $y$, we find that $x = 30$ and $y = 20$. Thus, $30$ milliliters of the $5\\%$ solution and $20$ milliliters of the $10\\%$ solution must be mixed to make $50$ milliliters of the $9\\%$ solution.\n\nAlternatively, we could have used the equation $0.05x + 0.10y = 0.09(x+y)$ to represent the second equation.

Solving for $d$ in terms of $n$, we have $d = \\frac{62 - n}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting into the equation $n + d = 36$, we have  \\begin{align*}\nn + \\frac{62 - n}{2} &= 36 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{3n + 62 - n}{2} &= 36 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{2n + 62}{2} &= 36 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow n + 31 &= 36 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow n &= 5.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the number of dimes is $\\frac{62 - 5}{2} = \\boxed{31}$.

We can solve for $y$ in $x + y = 320$ to get $y = 320 - x$. We then substitute $x$ and $y$ into $16x + 8y = 320$ to get $16x + 8(320 - x) = 320$, which simplifies to $960 - 8x = 0$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x = 120$. We plug this into $y = 320 - x$ to find that $y = 160$. So we need $120$ pounds of soybean meal and $160$ pounds of cornmeal to create our $320$-pound mixture that is $13$% protein. The answer is 120",

    "output": "Let K be the amount of Kenyan French Roast coffee and S be the amount of Sumatran coffee in the blend. We know that K + S = 20 and price = 8.40 dollars per pound. Since the price of Kenyan French Roast is 9 dollars per pound, the cost of K pounds of Kenyan French Roast is 9K dollars. Similarly, the cost of S pounds of Sumatran coffee is 8S dollars. Thus, the cost of the blend is 9K + 8S dollars. We know that the cost of the blend is 8.40 dollars per pound, or 8.40 = (9K + 8S) / 20. Solving for S, we get 8.40 = (9K + 8S) / 20, or 168 = 9K + 8S.

We can rewrite the equation as $0.2a + 0.6b = 0.45(a+b)$ as $0.2a + 0.6b = 0.45a + 0.45b$ and then as $0.15a = -0.05b$. Then, we can divide both sides by $0.15$ to get $a = \\frac{-0.05b}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{3}b$.\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are positive, we know that $a$ must equal $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $b$. Also, we know that $a+b = 80$, so we can substitute $a = \\frac{1}{3}b$ into the equation $a+b = 80$ to get $\\frac{1}{3}b+b = 80$. Combining like terms, we get $\\frac{4}{3}b = 80$, so multiplying both sides by $\\frac{3}{4}$ gives $b = 60$. Substituting this value back into the equation $a = \\frac{1}{3}b$, we find that $a = \\frac{1}{3}(60) = 20$.

The annual return for the investment at 4 % is 4/100*x dollars, and the same for the 5 % investment is 5/100*(8000-x) dollars.\nThe total return from the two investments is 4/100*x + 5/100*(8000-x) = 380 dollars.\nThis translates to 4x+40000-5x=38000.\nx=2000\nTherefore, Lisa invested 2000 dollars at 4 %, and (8000-2000=6000) dollars were invested at 5 %.\nThe answer is 2000,6000",

    "output": "The art dealer sold 16 etchings for 630 dollars, so he sold 630/35 = 18 etchings at 35 dollars each.\nThe art dealer also sold 16 etchings for 630 dollars, so he sold 630/45 = 14 etchings at 45 dollars each.\nThe answer is 18",

    "question": "A plane flying with a tail wind flew at a speed of 460 miles per hour , relative to the ground. When flying against the tailwind , it flew at a speed of 310 miles per hour. Find the speed of the tailwind. ",
    "output": "Let V be the speed of the plane in still air, and let W be the speed of the tail wind. Since the plane flew against the tail wind at a speed of 310 miles per hour, this means that the wind speed is W and the speed of the plane is V+W. This also means that the speed of the plane flying with the tail wind is V-W.\nWe know that the speed of the plane flying with the tail wind is 460, and the speed of the plane flying against the tail wind is 310. We can set up the following equation: 460 = V-W and 310 = V+W.\nIf we add the two equations, we get 460 + 310 = 2V.\nIf we divide both sides by 2, we get V = 330.\nIf we subtract the two equations, we get 460 - 310 = 2W.\nIf we divide both sides by 2, we get W = 150.\nThe answer is 150",

    "question": "At Al 's Rent-a-Center , it costs 30 dollars more per month to rent a leather couch than it does to rent a microfiber couch. Pauline rented a leather couch for 8 months and then exchanged it for a microfiber couch , which she rented for 12 months. She paid a total of 1620 dollars to rent these couches. Solve this system of equations to find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch , in dollars. Find the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch. ",
    "output": "Let L be the monthly rental charge for the leather couch and M be the monthly rental charge for the microfiber couch. We know that L = M + 30 and M + 12L = 1620.\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get M + 12(M + 30) = 1620\nThis simplifies to M + 12M + 360 = 1620\nThis simplifies to 13M = 1280\nThis means that M = 1280 / 13 = 92.\nSubstituting this value back into L = M + 30, we get L = 92 + 30 = 122.\nThe answer is 122",
