    "question": "Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74",
    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nTo solve this question, we first need to set up an equation for the area of the garden. If x is the length of the longer side, then the area is x(10). Since the area is 240, we have the equation x(10) = 240. Solving for x, we get x = 24. Since the side of the garden that is not fenced has length 10, we need 24 - 10 = 14 meters of fencing on that side. For the two shorter sides, we need fencing of length x, so we need 2x = 24 + 2(14) = 52 meters of fencing.\nThe answer is A.",
