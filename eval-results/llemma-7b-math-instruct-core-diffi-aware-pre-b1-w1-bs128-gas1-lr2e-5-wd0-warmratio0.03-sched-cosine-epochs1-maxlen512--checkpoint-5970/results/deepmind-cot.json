Since $90 = 10^2$, we have $451^{1/10} = (10^2)^{1/10} = 10^{2\\cdot 1/10} = 10^{1/5}$.  To the nearest integer, $10^{1/5} = \\boxed{2}$. The answer is 2",

    "output": "First, let's solve for h. We start by simplifying the numerator of the fraction: (-8)/(-3) = 8/3. Then we simplify the denominator of the fraction: (-10)/(-15) = 10/15 = 2/3. So, h = 8/3 / 2/3 = 8/3 * 3/2 = 4.\nNow, let's solve for s. We take the equation 4*y = 5*s + 84 - 33 and multiply both sides by 5 to get 20*y = 5*s + 420 - 165. We can rewrite this as 20*y - 5*s = 255. Now, we take the equation -w*y + h*s = -39 and multiply both sides by 20 to get -20*w*y + 4*s*h = -780. We can rewrite this as -20*w*y + 4*s*h - 780 = 0. We'll use s*h - 780 = 0 to substitute for s in 20*y - 5*s = 255. We get 20*y - 5*s = 255, so 20*y - 5*(s*h - 780) = 255. Expanding the right side, we get 20*y - 5*s*h + 3900 = 255. We can rewrite this as 20*y - 5*s*h + 3900 - 255 = 0. This gives us 20*y - 5*s*h + 3655 = 0. Now, we'll substitute s*h - 780 = 0 for s in 20*y - 5*s*h + 3655 = 0. We get 20*y - 5*(s*h - 780) + 3655 = 0, so 20*y - 5*s*h + 3900 - 255 = 0. Expanding the right side, we get 20*y - 5*s*h + 3655 = 0. Now, we'll substitute 4 for h in 20*y - 5*s*h + 3655 = 0. We get 20*y - 5*s*4 + 3655 = 0, so 20*y - 20*s + 3655 = 0. This gives us 20*(y - s) + 3655 = 0. So, y - s = -3655/20, which means y = -3655/20 + s.\nWe'll substitute y = -3655/20 + s into 20*y - 5*s*h + 3655 = 0. We get 20*(-3655/20 + s) - 5*s*4 + 3655 = 0, so -3655 + 20*s - 20*s + 3655 = 0. This simplifies to 4110 = 20*s. So, s = 4110/20 = 205. List the prime factors of y: 205 = 3*5*41, so the prime factors of y are 3, 5, and 41. The answer is 354",

    "output": "Let $f(x) = x^{19} + x^{18} + \\cdots + x + 1$.  Then, $f(x)$ is a degree 19 polynomial, so it has 20 roots in the complex numbers.  We can write $f(x)$ as a product of 20 linear factors: \\[f(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)\\cdots (x - r_{19})(x - r_{20}).\\]Let $k$ be a $19^{th}$ root of unity, so $k^{19} = 1$ and $k^{18} = k^{-1}$.  Therefore, $f(k) = 1 + k + k^2 + \\cdots + k^{18} + k^{19} = 0$, so $k$ is a root of $f(x)$.  Similarly, $k^2$ is a root of $f(x)$, and so is $k^3$, and so on.  In fact, each of the 20 complex roots of $f(x)$ is a root of unity, and so they are all of the form $k^n$, for some integer $n$.\n\nWe can factor $x^{19} + x^{18} + \\cdots + x + 1$ further with polynomial division.  First, we divide by $x - 1$, to get $x^{19} + x^{18} + \\cdots + x + 1 = (x - 1)(x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + x^2 + x + 1)$.  We can divide the remaining factor by $x - k$, to get  \\[x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + x^2 + x + 1 = (x - k)(x^{17} + x^{16} + \\cdots + x^3 + x^2 + x + k).\\]We can divide the remaining factor by $x - k^2$, to get  \\[x^{17} + x^{16} + \\cdots + x^3 + x^2 + x + k = (x - k^2)(x^{16} + x^{15} + \\cdots + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + k^2).\\]We can divide the remaining factor by $x - k^3$, to get  \\[x^{16} + x^{15} + \\cdots + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + k^2 = (x - k^3)(x^{15} + x^{14} + \\cdots + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + k^3).\\]Continuing in this way, we find that \\[f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - k^2)(x - k^3) \\cdots (x - k^{18})(x - k^{19}).\\]for some complex number $k$ and 19th roots of unity $k^2$, $k^3$, $\\ldots$, $k^{19}$.\n\nWe can factor $f(x)$ further with polynomial division.  First, we divide by $x - 1$, to get $f(x) = (x - 1)(x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + x + 1)$.  We can divide the remaining factor by $x - k$, to get  \\[x^{18} + x^{17} + \\cdots + x + 1 = (x - k)(x^{17} + x^{16} + \\cdots + x^2 + x + k).\\]We can divide the remaining factor by $x - k^2$, to get  \\[x^{17} + x^{16} + \\cdots + x^2 + x + k = (x - k^2)(x^{16} + x^{15} + \\cdots + x^3 + x^2 + x + k^2).\\]We can divide the remaining factor by $x - k^3$, to get  \\[x^{16} + x^{15} + \\cdots + x^3 + x^2 + x + k^2 = (x - k^3)(x^{15} + x^{14} + \\cdots + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + k^3).\\]Continuing in this way, we find that \\[f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - k^2)(x - k^3) \\cdots (x - k^{18})(x - k^{19}).\\]for some complex number $k$ and 19th roots of unity $k^2$, $k^3$, $\\ldots$, $k^{19}$.\n\nSince $k^{19} = 1$, we have $f(k) = 0$.  We also have $f(1) = 1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1 + 1 = 19$, so $f(x)$ has two roots: $x = 1$ and $x = k$.  Therefore, $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)$, and we can factor $f(x)$ further with polynomial division.  We divide by $x - k$, to get $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - k^{18})$.  Therefore, $k^{18} = 1$, so $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - 1)(x - k^{17})$.  We divide by $x - k^{17}$, to get $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - 1)(x - k^{17})(x - k^{16})$.  We divide by $x - k^{16}$, to get $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - 1)(x - k^{17})(x - k^{16})(x - k^{15})$.  We divide by $x - k^{15}$, to get $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - 1)(x - k^{17})(x - k^{16})(x - k^{15})(x - k^{14})$.  We divide by $x - k^{14}$, to get $f(x) = (x - 1)(x - k)(x - 1)(x - k^{17})",

Simplifying the first equation gives -4*r + 8*l + 58 = 0, and then multiplying both sides by -1 gives 4*r - 8*l - 58 = 0.  Dividing both sides by 4 gives r - 2*l - 14.5 = 0.  Subtracting 14.5 from both sides gives r - 2*l = 14.5, and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives 2*r - 4*l = 29.  Adding this to the second equation above gives 2*r - 4*l - 8*l - r - 21 = 0, which simplifies to -6*l - r - 21 = 0.  Subtracting 21 from both sides gives -6*l - r = 21, and then multiplying both sides by -1 gives 6*l + r = -21.  Dividing both sides by 6 gives l + r/6 = -3.5.

Multiplying both sides by -1 gives k - 5*y = 55.  Adding this to -k + 5*y = -55 gives 0 = 0, which means that the system is dependent.  Therefore, every solution to the system is a solution to the original equation, but not necessarily the other way around.\n\nThe system is then solved as follows:\n-k + 5*y = -55\nk - 5*y = 55\nAdding the two equations gives 0 = 0, so they are dependent.  Therefore, any y that makes the original equation true will also make the system true.  Setting the original equation to zero gives  -6450*y + 139 = 3*k - 6452*y, or  -6450*y + 6452*y = 3*k - 139.  Simplifying gives 12*y = 3*k - 139, so  k = 12*y + 139/3.  If  y = 1, then k = 12*1 + 139/3 = 40.  If y = 2, then k = 12*2 + 139/3 = 80.  If y = 3, then k = 12*3 + 139/3 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the possible values for k are 40, 80, and 120.  Since we have no restrictions on y, the possible values for y are all real numbers.  So, the solution set is $\\boxed{(y, k) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times \\{40, 80, 120\\}}$. The answer is (y,k)\\in\\mathbb{R}\\times\\{40,80,120\\}",

Now we can use h to solve for t in h*t - 5*t = 20: t = (20 + 5*t)/(8/3 - 5) = (20 + 5*t)/(8/3 - 5*t) = 0.

Substitute -2*j + 1 for a in the equation. -2*j + 1 = 5*a = 5*(-240*x + 241*x) = -1200*x + 1205*x. Add 1200 to both sides of the equation. -2*j = -1200*x + 1205*x = 1205*x - 1200*x = 5*x.

Adding 16 to both sides gives 24/q = a, and since we know that 202 = 19*a - 64, we can substitute to get 24/q = 202/19 - 16.

Differentiating -v**4/24 once gives -2*v**3/3, differentiating -2*v**3/3 once gives -2*v**2, and differentiating -2*v**2 once gives -4*v.

To find the derivative of f(w), we use the power rule, which states that the derivative of w**n is n*w**(n-1). The derivative of w**3/3 is (3/3)*w**(3-1) = w**2. The derivative of -w**2 is -2*w**(2-1) = -2w. The derivative of w is 1, and the derivative of a constant, 24, is 0. So, the derivative of f(w) is f'(w) = w**2 - 2w + 1.\nNow, we substitute f = -2 + 5 into f'(w) = w**2 - 2w + 1 to find p(f): p(f) = (-2 + 5)**2 - 2*(-2 + 5) + 1 = 4**2 - 2*4 + 1 = 16 - 8 + 1 = 9.\nNext, we substitute k = 9 into o(h) = -h**3 + 3*h**2 + 3*h - 3 to find o(k): o(k) = -9**3 + 3*9**2 + 3*9 - 3 = -729 + 243 + 27 - 3 = -729 + 249 + 24 = -729 + 273 = -456.\nThe answer is -456",
