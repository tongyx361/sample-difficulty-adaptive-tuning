    "output": "The formula for CuCO3 is (CuC2O2)2CO3. If we break it down into its components, there are 2 Cu, 2 C, 3 O, and 3 CO3. If we add up the number of oxygens, that comes to 6. If we add up the number of oxygens in the formula for CuCO3, that comes to 3. The fraction of oxygen in the compound is 3/6, which is 50% of the total. The mass percentage of oxygen is (50/100)*(16)=8 grams of oxygen for every 100 grams of CuCO3. Thus, the answer is 8",

The first number is the mass number and the second number is the atomic number. The first number is the sum of the protons and the neutrons and the second number is the number of protons. The number of protons is the same for the entire atom, so the sum of the masses of the isotopes is the sum of the number of protons times the average of the atomic weights.\n\nIn this case, since Aluminum only has one isotope, we don't need to take the average of the atomic weights.
