    "output": "Let C be the amount of Columbian coffee and B be the amount of Brazilian coffee in pounds. We know that C + B = 100 and we want to find the value of B.\nWe also know that C is 8.75 times the value of B, meaning C = 8.75 * B.\nSubstituting the value of C in the first equation, we get 8.75*B + B = 100\nCombining like terms, we get 9.75*B = 100\nDividing both sides by 9.75, we get B = 100/9.75 = 1000/97.5 = 100/9.75 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 = 100/97.5 =",

    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nIn order to determine who is faster, we must first determine how long it takes each to reach their destination. We begin by figuring out how long it takes the hare to run 1000 meters.\nWe know the hare runs at a speed of 21 cm/s, and it needs to run 1000 meters. We can convert this distance to centimeters by multiplying the number of meters by 100, so 1000 meters x 100 centimeters/meter = 100,000 centimeters.\nWe can divide the total distance the hare needs to run by his speed to find out how long it takes him to run it, 100,000 centimeters / 21 centimeters/second = 4,761.90 seconds.\nWe can convert this time to minutes by dividing by 60, 4,761.90 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 76.19 minutes.\nIt will take the hare 76 minutes to run to his destination.\nWe can use a similar process to determine how long it takes the tortoise to run to his destination. We know the tortoise has a speed of 2 meters/minute, and he needs to run 1000 meters. We can divide the total distance by the tortoise\u2019s speed to find out how long it takes him, 1000 meters / 2 meters/minute = 500 minutes.\nIt will take the tortoise 500 minutes to run to his destination.\nSince the hare will take 76 minutes to run to his destination and the tortoise will take 500 minutes to run to his destination, the hare has a longer running time.\nThe answer is A",

    "question": "At Al 's Rent-a-Center , it costs 30 dollars more per month to rent a leather couch than it does to rent a microfiber couch. Pauline rented a leather couch for 8 months and then exchanged it for a microfiber couch , which she rented for 12 months. She paid a total of 1620 dollars to rent these couches. Solve this system of equations to find the monthly rental charge for the leather couch , in dollars.",
    "output": "Let L be the monthly charge for a leather couch and M be the monthly charge for a microfiber couch. \"It costs 30 dollars more per month to rent a leather couch than it does to rent a microfiber couch\" means that L = M + 30. \"Pauline rented a leather couch for 8 months and then exchanged it for a microfiber couch , which she rented for 12 months\" means that she rented the leather couch for 8 months and the microfiber couch for 12 months. This gives the equations L \u00d7 8 = 1620 M \u00d7 12 = 1620\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second to eliminate L since both equations are equal to 1620. M \u00d7 12 = 1620 - 30M + 30 M \u00d7 12 = 1620 - 30M + 30\nNow we can combine like terms on the right side of the equation. M \u00d7 12 = 1620 - 30M + 30 = 1620 - 30M + 30 = 1650 - 30M\nNow we can divide both sides of the equation by -30 to solve for M. -30 M = 1650 - 1620 -30 M = 1650 - 1620\nNow we can add 1620 to both sides of the equation. -30 M + 1620 = 1650 - 1620 + 1620\nNow we can combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -30 M + 1620 = 1650 - 1620 = 1650\nNow we can divide both sides of the equation by -30 to solve for M. M = 1650 / -30 M = -55\nSince we know that L = M + 30, we can substitute -55 + 30 for L in the equation L \u00d7 8 = 1620\nNow we can multiply both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for L. L \u00d7 8 = 1620 - 55 \u00d7 8 = 1620 - 440 = 1200\nThe answer is 1200",
