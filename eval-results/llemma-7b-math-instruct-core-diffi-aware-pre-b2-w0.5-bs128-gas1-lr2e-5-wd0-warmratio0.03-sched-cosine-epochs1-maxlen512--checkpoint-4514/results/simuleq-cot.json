    "question": "River Joes 's Seafood Diner charges 6.00 dollars for a catfish dinner and 3.50 dollars for an order of popcorn shrimp. After filling 26 orders , River Joe had collected 133.50 dollars. How many orders of popcorn shrimp and catfish dinners did they sell? ",
    "output": "Let x be the number of catfish dinners and y be the number of orders of popcorn shrimp. We know that 6x + 3.5y = 133.50 and x + y = 26. Solving for x in the second equation gives x = 26 - y. Substituting this into the first equation gives 6(26 - y) + 3.5y = 133.50. Canceling a factor of 6 gives 26 - y + 3.5y = 133.50. Combining like terms gives 2.5y = 107.50. Dividing both sides by 2.5 gives y = 42. Now, we know that x = 26 - 42 = 14. Therefore, they sold 42 catfish dinners and 14 orders of popcorn shrimp.

We can solve for S and N by substituting S + N = 2000 into the second equation. 7S + 10N = 17339 becomes 7S + 10(2000 - S) = 17339.

Substituting this into the second equation, we get 5*x + 20*(13 - x) = 155. This simplifies to 5*x + 260 - 20*x = 155. Next, we combine like terms, 5*x - 20*x = 155 - 260.

Simplifying, we get 1/20*x + 1/4*y = 9/5. We want to find a ratio of x:y that satisfies this equation, which means we want the denominators of x and y to be equal. Since 20*4 = 80, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 80 to get 40x + 20y = 720. Now we have an equation of the form ax + by = c, where a = 40, b = 20, and c = 720. We can divide both sides of the equation by 20 to get 2x + y = 36. Now we use the method of elimination. We can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get 4x + 2y = 72. This means x:y = 72:36 = 1:1. So the ratio of 5 % saline solution to 25 % saline solution is 1:1. To get 10 liters of 18 % saline solution, we must mix 10 liters of 5 % saline solution with 10 liters of 25 % saline solution. The answer is 10",

We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information.

Multiply the first equation by 1.50 and subtract the second equation from the result: 1.50X + 2200(1.50) = 5050 - 4.00Y 2200 + 3300 = 5050 - 4.00Y 5500 = 5050 - 4.00Y 50 = -4.00Y Dividing both sides by -4, we get: 12.5 = Y.

    "output": "Let's say x is the amount invested at 10% and y is the amount invested at 8%. Since there is a total of 5000, x + y = 5000. The interest for the amount invested at 10% is 10% * x = 0.1*x, and the interest for the amount invested at 8% is 8% * y = 0.8 * y. The total interest is 0.1*x + 0.8*y = 460. By adding 0.1*x + 0.8*y = 460 and x + y = 5000, we get 1.1*x + 0.2*y = 5040. By multiplying 100 to both sides of the equation, we get 110*x + 2*y = 504000. By dividing 110*x + 2*y = 504000 by 110, we get x + 1/55*y = 4560. Since x + y = 5000, x = 5000 - y. Substituting x in x + 1/55*y = 4560, we get 5000 - y + 1/55*y = 4560. By combining like terms, we get 5000 + 1/55*y = 4560. By subtracting 5000 from both sides, we get 1/55*y = -440. By multiplying both sides by 55, we get y = -2200.

    "output": "Let C be the number of pounds of Columbian coffee and B be the number of pounds of Brazilian coffee.\nIf 100 pounds of the coffee mix sold for 6.35 dollars per pound, then the total cost of the mix was 635 dollars.\nThe cost of Columbian coffee was 8.75C dollars.\nThe cost of Brazilian coffee was 3.75B dollars.\nThe total cost of the Columbian and Brazilian coffee was 8.75C + 3.75B dollars.\nThe equation for the total cost of the mix is 635 = 8.75C + 3.75B.\nDividing both sides by 3.75 gives 165 = 8.75C + B.\nSubtracting 8.75C from both sides gives 165 - 8.75C = B.\nThus, the number of pounds of Brazilian coffee in the mix is 165 - 8.75C.\nThe ratio of Columbian coffee to Brazilian coffee is 8.75:165-8.75.\nThe ratio simplifies to 8.75:87.25.\nThe ratio simplifies to 1:10.\nThus, the number of pounds of each type of coffee in the mix is 100/10 = 10 pounds.\nThe answer is 10",

    "output": "Let C be the number of crocus bulbs and let D be the number of daffodil bulbs. We know that C + D = 55 and we also know that 0.35C + 0.65D = 29.15. If we multiply the second equation by 100, we will eliminate the decimal point and make the equation easier to deal with. When we do this, we get 35C + 65D = 2915. Now we can use the first equation to substitute D for C in the second equation. We get 35C + 65(55 - C) = 2915. When we multiply 65 by 55, we get 3675. We know that 35C = 2915 - 3675 = -760. Dividing both sides of this equation by 35, we get C = -22. Now we can substitute this value for C into the first equation to solve for D. Doing this, we get -22 + D = 55. Adding 22 to both sides, we get D = 77. The number of crocus bulbs is 22 and the number of daffodil bulbs is 77. The answer is 22",

    "output": "Let x be the number of gallons used by the 25 mile per gallon car, and let y be the number of gallons used by the 40 mile per gallon car. We know that x + y = 55, because the total number of gallons consumed is the sum of the gallons consumed by each car. We also know that 25x + 40y = 1825, because the total distance driven is the sum of the distance driven by each car. We can solve the first equation for y, finding y = 55 - x. Substituting that into the second equation, we get 25x + 40(55 - x) = 1825. This simplifies to 25x + 2200 - 40x = 1825, which simplifies further to -5x = -375, or x = 75. Substituting that value into y = 55 - x, we find that y = 55 - 75 = -20. So the 25 mile per gallon car consumed 75 gallons, and the 40 mile per gallon car consumed -20 gallons. The answer is 75",
