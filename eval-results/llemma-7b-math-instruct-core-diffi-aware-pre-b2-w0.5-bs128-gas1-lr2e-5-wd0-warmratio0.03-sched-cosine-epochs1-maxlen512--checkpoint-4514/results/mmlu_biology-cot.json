    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nWater has a high heat capacity. This means that it takes a LOT of energy to heat up water. In fact, water is often used as a coolant for nuclear reactors because it can absorb a lot of energy without becoming boiling.\nWater also has high cohesion. This means that it sticks to itself. Because of this, it can form bonds with other molecules, including those in the air.\nWater also has high adhesion. This means that it sticks to other surfaces. Because of this, it can climb up the stems of plants and other surfaces (like the inside of your eyes when you get a cold).\nWater has high hydrophobicity. This means that it doesn't like to be in contact with other water molecules. This is why you can't pour water on your hands (the water beads up because your hands are hydrophobic and the water is hydrophilic).\nWater also has capillary action. This is a combination of its other properties. For example, water clings to the inside of capillary tubes and sticks to itself, so it can climb up the tubes and fill even the smallest spaces.\nThe answer is D",

(B) It reoxidizes NADH so that glycolysis can continue. (C) It produces pyruvate, which is the raw material for oxidative phosphorylation. (D) It occurs in the cytoplasm.",
    "output": "The answer is A\nGlycolysis is a set of metabolic reactions that break down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate with the help of ATP and H2O. The end-products of glycolysis are pyruvate (which is a precursor for gluconeogenesis) and ATP. The main function of glycolysis is to produce ATP, which is the source of energy for most cellular activities. In addition, glycolysis relies on NAD+ to generate ATP, and therefore, it is necessary to reoxidize NADH to NAD+ so that glycolysis can continue.",

    "question": "This process couples the production of ATP with the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain by harnessing the driving force created by a proton gradient.\nAnswer Choices: (A) Glycolysis (B) Chemiosmosis (C) Fermentation (D) Calvin cycle",
    "output": "Chemiosmosis is the movement of ions across a semipermeable membrane down an electrochemical gradient. It is a key step in the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain is a series of electron transporters and carriers that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions. The electron donors are the electron providers and the electron acceptors are the electron consumers. In the context of chemiosmosis, the electron donors are the NADH and FADH2 molecules that are produced during glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. The electron acceptors are the oxygen molecules in the air. The electron transport chain is also known as the oxidative phosphorylation because it involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, which results in the oxidation of the electron donors and the reduction of the oxygen molecules. The overall reaction for the electron transport chain is: 2 NADH + 2 FADH2 + 2 H+ + 1/2 O2 \u2192 2 NAD+ + 2 FAD + H2O The H+ ions are pumped across the membrane by the proton pump, which is part of the ATP synthase complex. The energy from the proton pump is used to synthesize ATP by the ATP synthase complex.

The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column. This is incorrect. The ascent of water through the xylem is due to the difference in hydrostatic pressure between the source and sink regions. The conduit for an ascent of water is provided by the xylem vessels, not the living cells.",

    "question": "In fungi, cell walls are reinforced by which of the following?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Chitin (B) Silica (C) Lignin (D) Collagen fibers",
    "output": "Chitin is a glucose derivative that is used by fungi to build cell walls. It is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and may be stored in the form of a solid, such as in the cell wall of a fungus, or it can be dissolved in water. Lignin is a complex, highly unsaturated trisaccharide consisting of a three-ring structure. It is a natural phenolic compound found in the cell walls of plants and trees. Silica is a macromolecular compound that occurs in many plants and is used by fungi to build cell walls. It is a silicate with a tetrahedral structure. Collagen fibers are protein fibers that are used by fungi to build cell walls. They are made up of three polypeptide chains that are cross-linked to form collagen fibrils. The answer is A.",

    "output": "The early-successional plant community is dominated by K-selected species. K-selection is a type of selection in which the rate of growth is proportional to the amount of resources already acquired. These species have a high frequency because they are able to take advantage of environmental fluctuations and low competition. The answer is C.",

    "output": "The correct answer is (C) Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube\nPhloem is the tissue that facilitates the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem. The sucrose is moved in the phloem by the symplastic pathway, which includes the following tissues: companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, and sieve tubes. The answer is C.",
