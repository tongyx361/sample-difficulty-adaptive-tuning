We can simplify this expression to 145468/336 + 12/24.\nWe can use the distributive property to obtain 145468/336 + 12/24 = 459/11 + 12/24 = 42*11 + 3*2 = 482 + 6 = 488.\nSince the remainder is less than 10, we can simply consider the tens digit of this number to find the remainder. 488 ends in an 8, so the remainder when it is divided by 10 is $\\boxed{8}$.

Substituting this into z = 5*t - 14, we get z = 5*4 - 14 = -6.\n\nNow, we find the second derivative of -f**4/12 - 7*f**3/6 - 2*f. The first term is -f**4/12, so its second derivative is -4*f**3/12 = -f**3/3. The second term is -7*f**3/6, so its second derivative is -7*f**3/6 = -7*f**3/6. The third term is -2*f, so its second derivative is 2.

The derivative of this function is -5/4*5*x**4 + 35/6*3*x**2 + 16.  The derivative of this function is -5/4*20*x**3 + 35/6*6*x = -50*x**3 + 175*x.

We know that y(29) is equivalent to the remainder when 2*(29)**3 - 58*(29)**2 + 10*29 + 22 is divided by 85.\n\nWe calculate the remainder when 2*(29)**3 - 58*(29)**2 + 10*29 + 22 is divided by 85.\n\nFirst, we find the remainder when 2*(29)**3 is divided by 85. Since 29 is equivalent to 14 mod 85, we have that 2*(29)**3 is equivalent to 2*(14)**3 mod 85. Since 14**3 is 224, we have that 2*(14)**3 is equivalent to 2*224 mod 85. Since 2*224 is 448, we have that 2*224 is equivalent to 448 mod 85, which is 29 mod 85.\n\nNext, we find the remainder when 58*(29)**2 is divided by 85. Since 29 is equivalent to 14 mod 85, we have that 58*(29)**2 is equivalent to 58*(14)**2 mod 85. Since 14**2 is 196, we have that 58*(14)**2 is equivalent to 58*196 mod 85.

Since 29 is equivalent to 14 mod 85, we have that 10*29 is equivalent to 10*14 mod 85. Since 10*14 is 140, we have that 10*14 is equivalent to 140 mod 85, which is 25 mod 85.\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when 22 is divided by 85. This is simply 22.\n\nWe have that y(29) is equivalent to 29 mod 85 + 14 mod 85 + 25 mod 85 + 22 mod 85 = 29+14+25+22 = 85.\n\nTherefore, the remainder when y(29) is divided by 85 is 85-0 = 85.\n\nThe answer is 85",
