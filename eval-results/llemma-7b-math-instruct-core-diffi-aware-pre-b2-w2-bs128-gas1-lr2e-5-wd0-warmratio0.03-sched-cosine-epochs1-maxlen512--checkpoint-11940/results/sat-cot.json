After three years, the account has grown to $1.0404m + 0.02(1.0404m) = 1.0812m$.  Notice that the growth is exponential.\n\nOption B: Each successive year, $1.5 \\%$ of the initial savings and $\\$ 100$ is added to the value of the account.\n\nLet the initial amount of money be $m$.  After one year, the account has grown to $m + 0.015m + 100 = 1.015m + 100$.  After two years, the account has grown to $1.015m + 100 + 0.015(1.015m + 100) = 1.04975m + 110.25$.  After three years, the account has grown to $1.04975m + 110.25 + 0.015(1.04975m + 110.25) = 1.09901m + 121.0075$.  Again, the growth is exponential.\n\nThus, option A is the exponential growth plan.

    "output": "Let's solve the multi-choice question step by step.\nThere are 15 horses.\nLet the lowest weight be x.\nThen the remaining weights are greater than or equal to x + 10.\nThe median is the average of the 8th and 9th largest weights.\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest weights.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of the spread of the data.\nCorrecting the lowest weight changes the mean, median, and range.\nThe standard deviation, however, is unchanged.\nThe answer is D.",

    "output": "First, we note that the percentages do not add up to $100 \\%$. The host reported that $28 \\%$ of respondents answered \"Yes\" and $70 \\%$ of respondents answered \"No,\" so the sum is $28 \\% + 70 \\% = 98 \\%$. This means that the rest of the percentages must be equal to $2 \\%$, and this is not a likely split in the actual population.\n\nSecond, the host did not specify how many people were polled. It is possible that the number of people who responded to the poll was very small, so the percentages do not necessarily represent the actual percentages in the population.\n\nThird, the host did not specify how many people were polled. It is possible that the number of people who responded to the poll was very large, so the percentages do not necessarily represent the actual percentages in the population.\n\nFourth, the host allowed viewers to respond to the poll for only a short time. This means that the percentages are not a true representation of the population, because not all people had a chance to respond.\n\nTherefore, the host's report that $28 \\%$ of people responded \"Yes\" and $70 \\%$ of people responded \"No\" is unlikely to represent the sentiments of the population of the United States.

    "output": "The problem is asking us for a polynomial function $f(x)$ that has two distinct roots $a$ and $b$, where $a$ and $b$ are both positive. We know that if a polynomial has a root at $x=a$, then $(x-a)$ must be a factor of the polynomial. Similarly, if a polynomial has a root at $x=b$, then $(x-b)$ must be a factor of the polynomial. Therefore, the polynomial must be of the form $f(x) = k(x-a)(x-b)$, where $k$ is a nonzero constant. Now, we can choose a value for $k$ and check the answer choices to see which one matches the form. Since $a$ and $b$ are both positive, we know that $x-a$ and $x-b$ must have a positive leading coefficient. Therefore, $k$ must be positive.\n\nA. $f(x)=(x-a)(x-b)$ This function is a perfect match for our definition of $f(x)$. The only thing left to check is the sign of the constant $k$. Since we know that $f(x)$ must be positive, we must have $k>0$.\n\nB. $f(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$ This function is not a match, since $(x+a)$ and $(x+b)$ would both have a negative leading coefficient, which would make $f(x)$ negative.\n\nC. $f(x)=(x-a)(x+b)$ This function is not a match, since $(x-a)$ has a leading coefficient of 1, but $(x+b)$ has a leading coefficient of $-1$.\n\nD. $f(x)=x(x-a)(x-b)$ This function is not a match, since it includes a factor of $x$, which changes the root at $x=0$ to a factor of the constant term.
