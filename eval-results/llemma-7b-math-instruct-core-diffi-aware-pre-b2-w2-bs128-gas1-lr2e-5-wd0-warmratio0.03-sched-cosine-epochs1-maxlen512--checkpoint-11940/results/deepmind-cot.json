So we start by finding the first derivative of the function. The first term has a power of 4, so the first derivative of this term is -5*4*o**3/6 = -10*o**3/6. The second term has a power of 2, so the first derivative of this term is -51*2*o = -102*o. The third term has a power of 1, so the first derivative of this term is -4. Adding these first derivatives together, we get the first derivative of the function: c'(o) = -10*o**3/6 - 102*o - 4. Next we have to find the second derivative of this function. The second derivative is found by differentiating the first derivative, so we have to find the first derivative of c'(o). The first term, -10*o**3/6, uses the power rule for differentiation, which states that the derivative of x**n is n*x**(n-1). So the first derivative of this term is -10*3*o**2/6 = -5*o**2. The second term, -102*o, uses the power rule for differentiation, which states that the derivative of x is 1. So the first derivative of this term is -102. Adding these first derivatives together, we get the second derivative of the function: c''(o) = -5*o**2 - 102. So the first derivative of c(o) is -5*o**2 - 102. The answer is -5*o**2 - 102",

So, the expression becomes ((sqrt(4)*sqrt(3)*sqrt(11)/sqrt(3)*2 - sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(11))/(sqrt(24)/sqrt(486)) = ((2*sqrt(3)*sqrt(11) - 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(11))/(sqrt(24)/sqrt(486)) = (2*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*sqrt(11))/(sqrt(24)/sqrt(486)). We can simplify the denominator: sqrt(24) = sqrt(4*6) = sqrt(4)*sqrt(6), and sqrt(486) = sqrt(2*233) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(233). So, the expression becomes (2*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*sqrt(11))/(sqrt(4)*sqrt(6)/sqrt(2)*sqrt(233)) = (2*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*sqrt(11))/(sqrt(4)/sqrt(2))*sqrt(6)/sqrt(233) = 2*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*sqrt(11)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(233)/sqrt(4)*sqrt(6) = 2*(sqrt(6)/sqrt(4))*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*sqrt(11)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(233) = 2*(3/2)*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*sqrt(11)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(233) = 3*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*sqrt(11)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(233). We can rewrite the expression under the square root sign as follows: sqrt(11)*sqrt(2)*sqrt(233) = sqrt(11*2*233) = sqrt(259) = 17. We have thus simplified the expression to 3*(sqrt(3) - sqrt(2))*17 = 3*sqrt(3)*17 - 3*sqrt(2)*17 = 51*sqrt(3) - 102*sqrt(2). Since 51 is a prime number, we can't simplify this further.

Using the power rule, which states that the derivative of x^n (where n is a constant) is n*x^(n-1), the first derivative of 26*u**3/3 is 26*3/3 * u**2 = 26*u**2.\nThe derivative of 35*u is 35, as the power rule gives us 0*u^(0-1) = 0.\nThe derivative of a constant, such as 26, is 0.\nAdding these together, we get that the first derivative of 26*u**3/3 + 35*u + 26 is 26*u**2 + 35 + 0 = 26*u**2 + 35.\nSince the derivative of a constant, such as f, is 0, the first derivative of o(f) is the first derivative of 26*f**2 + 35, which is 26*2*f = 52*f.\nThe answer is 52",

Dividing both sides of the second equation by -2, we get f = 1098*c - 4.  Substituting this value for f into the first equation, we get 1098*c - 4 + 25*c = 104, or 1098*c + 21*c = 108.  Combining like terms, we get 1121*c = 108, so c = 108/1121 = 108/1121.

    "output": "First, we need to simplify the expression for t. We start by performing the division inside the parentheses by 9, which gives us 12/11. We then subtract 9 from this value, which yields 12/11 - 9 = -78/11. Since the parentheses around the expression for t are already there, we can simply write -78/11 - 9 to get -87/11.\n\nNow we substitute t = -87/11 into the function l(p) = -p**3 - 4*p**2 - p + 9. We get  l(-87/11) = -(-87/11)**3 - 4*(-87/11)**2 - (-87/11) + 9 = 87**3 / 11**3 - 4*87**2 / 11**2 - 87/11 + 9. We can simplify this to 87**3 / 11**3 - 4*87**2 / 11**2 - 87/11 + 9 = 87**2 / 11**2 - 4*87**2 / 11**2 - 87/11 + 9 = -3*87**2 / 11**2 + 9 = -3*87**2 / 121 + 9 = -789/121 + 9 = -63/11.\n\nThus, l(t) = l(-87/11) = -63/11.

We know that 8/16 = 1/2, so we have 5 + (3/8) / (39/260) = 5 + (3/8) * (260/39) = 5 + 3 * 5 = 5 + 15 = 20. Thus, the value of the expression is $\\boxed{20}$. The answer is 20",

Simplifying, we get -236 = -236 + 1 + (-236/5) + (-236/5) - 15*(-236/5) + 54*(-236/5) + 61. This simplifies to -236 = -236 + 1 + (-236/5) + (-236/5) + 236 + 54*(-236/5) + 61. This simplifies to -236 = 1 + (-236/5) + (-236/5) + 54*(-236/5) + 61. Cancelling 1 from both sides, we get -235 = (-236/5) + (-236/5) + 54*(-236/5) + 61.

We need to find the value of the numerator, 16 - 3680/16.

    "output": "We can rewrite the system of equations as 3n + 3y = 512, 2n - 4y = 332. From the first equation, n + y = 170. Substituting into the second equation, we get 2n - 4y = 332. Subtracting the first equation from this, we get n - 3y = 160. Substituting into the first equation, we get y = 170 - n. Substituting into the second equation, we get 2n - 4(170 - n) = 332. This simplifies to 3n = 244. So n = 84 and y = 86. We get p = 84 - 165 = -81. The remainder when 47 is divided by -81 is 47 - (-81) = 128.\n\nThe answer is 128",

Adding 22 to both sides and factoring a -3 from the right side yields 363 = -3*(w+2) + 5*l.  Dividing both sides by -3 yields 121 = w + 2 + 5*l/3.  Subtracting 2 from both sides yields 119 = w + 5*l/3.\n\nSubstituting into the first equation yields 260 = -10*w + 15*w + 4*l, 260 = 5*w + 4*l.  Multiplying both sides by 3 yields 780 = 15*w + 12*l, 12*l = 780 - 15*w.  Substituting for l in the second equation yields 119 = w + 12*l/3, 119 = w + 4*l.  Subtracting 4*l from both sides yields 119 - 4*l = w.  Substituting for w in the first equation yields 260 = -10*(119 - 4*l) + 15*(119 - 4*l) + 4*l, 260 = 1190 - 590 + 4*l, 4*l = 930 - 1190, l = -260/4 = -65.  Substituting for l in the second equation yields 119 = w + 4*l, 119 = w - 260/4, w = 119 + 260/4 = 119 + 65 = 184.\n\nThus, w = 184 and l = -65.  The answer is 184",

Adding the two equations, we get that -5u - 2r = -3x - 16 + 2c, so -5u - 2(2c + 1) = -3x - 16 + 2c.  Simplifying, we get that -5u - 4c - 2 = -3x - 16 + 2c.

Subtracting 42/15 from both sides, we get that 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x - 24/15 = 0, so 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x - 24/15 = 0.  Subtracting 24/15 from both sides, we get that 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x = 24/15, so 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x = 24/15.  Dividing by 3, we get that 4r*x + x - r*x = 16, so x = 16 - r*x.  Substituting into the second equation, we get that -5u + 3x - 19 = 0, so -5u + 3(16 - r*x) - 19 = 0.  Simplifying, we get that -5u - 52 - 3r*x = 19, so -5u - 3r*x = 19 + 52 = 71.  Dividing by -3, we get that 5u + r*x = -71/3, so u = -71/15 + r*x/3.  Substituting into the first equation, we get that -4*(-71/15 + r*x/3) + 3*x - r*x - 24 = 0, so 42/15 + 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x - 24 = 0.  Simplifying, we get that 42/15 + 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x - 24 = 0.  Subtracting 42/15 from both sides, we get that 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x - 24/15 = 0, so 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x - 24/15 = 0.  Subtracting 24/15 from both sides, we get that 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x = 24/15, so 4r*x/3 + 3*x - r*x = 24/15.  Dividing by 3, we get that 4r*x + x - r*x = 16, so x = 16 - r*x.  Substituting into the second equation, we get that -5u + 3x - 19 = 0, so -5",

First, let's calculate (-2 + -460).  Because addition is associative, we can rearrange these terms: (-2) + (-460) = -462.  Next, let's multiply this by -8: (-462)*(-8) = 3696.

Since we know that 316 divided by 11025 leaves a remainder of 10826, we know that the remainder when 316 is divided by n(11) is the remainder when 10826 is divided by n(11).

Now, we can rewrite the original expression as ((-18903)/4)/(-3/5)=((-18903)/4)*(-5/3). Because the numerator is a multiple of 4, we can simplify the expression by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 4. This gives us (-18903)/4*(-5/3)=[(-18903)/4]/[(-5)/3]=-473.

Adding this to the first equation, we get 0 = -5*s + 5*w - 15 + 27*w - 29*w - 6, so 0 = -5*s + 27*w - 15 - 29*w - 6, so 0 = -5*s + 27*w - 29*w - 15 - 6, so 0 = -5*s + 27*w - 29*w - 21.  Factoring the right side, we get 0 = -5*s + 3*(-29 + 27)*w - 21, so 0 = -5*s - 2*3*w - 21, so 0 = -5*s - 6*w - 21.  Adding 6*w and 21 to both sides, we get 0 = -5*s, so s = 0.\n\nNow, we solve for w.  From the second equation, we get 0 = -27*w + 29*w + 6, so 0 = 2*w + 6, so w = -3.  Substituting this into the first equation, we get 0 = -5*s + 5*w - 15, so 0 = -5*s + 5*(-3) - 15, so 0 = -5*s - 15 - 15, so 0 = -5*s - 30.  Dividing both sides by -5, we get 0 = s + 6, so s = -6.  Thus, s = \\boxed{-6} and w = -3. The answer is -6",
