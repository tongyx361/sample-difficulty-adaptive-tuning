    "question": "Advance tickets to a show cost 20 , and same-day tickets cost 30. The total number of tickets sold was 60 for total receipts of 1,600. How many same-day tickets were sold?",
    "output": "Let's use the total number of tickets sold to find the total amount of money made from ticket sales. Since the total number of tickets sold was 60, the total amount of money made from ticket sales is 60*20 = 1200 dollars.\nThe total amount of money made from ticket sales is 1600 dollars, and this is the sum of the amount of money made from the advance tickets and the same-day tickets.\nThe amount of money made from the advance tickets is 1600-1200 = 400 dollars.\nSince the price of an advance ticket is 20 dollars, the number of advance tickets sold is 400/20 = 20 tickets.\nSince the price of a same-day ticket is 30 dollars, the number of same-day tickets sold is 60-20 = 40 tickets.\nThe answer is 40",
