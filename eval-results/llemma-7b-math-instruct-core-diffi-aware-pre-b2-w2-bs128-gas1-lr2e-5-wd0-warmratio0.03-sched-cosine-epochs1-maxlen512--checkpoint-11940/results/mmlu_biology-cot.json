It is a number between 0 and 1. In a diploid species, the two alleles of a given gene have different frequencies. In a population, the frequencies of all the genes are different. Therefore, natural selection can change a species' gene frequency.\nA population's gene frequency: A population's gene frequency is the average of all the species' gene frequencies in the population. Since the species' gene frequencies can be different, the population's gene frequency can also be different. Therefore, natural selection can change a population's gene frequency.\nAn individual's genome: An individual's genome is a set of all the genes that individual carries.
