    "output": "Let's say the number of adult tickets sold is a and the number of student tickets sold is s. We can set up a system of two equations to represent the given information. Here are our two equations: a + s = 605 and 14a + 12s = 8,390.00. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get 2a = 605 - 605, or a = 0. That means no adult tickets were sold, which isn't possible given the information. So, we must have made a mistake in our second equation. Let's correct it: 14a + 12s = 8,390.00. Now, we find the least common multiple of 14 and 12, which is 108. So, we want to rewrite the equation in terms of 108: 108a + 108s = 8,390.00. We can rewrite the first equation as a + s = 605/108 = 5/6. So, we have 108a + 108s = 8,390.00 and a + s = 5/6. Solving for a in terms of s, we find a = (5/6)s. Now, we can substitute this into the first equation to solve for s: (5/6)s + s = 605/108. Combining like terms, we get 7/6s = 605/108, or s = 605/108 * 6/7 = 55. So, the number of student tickets sold is 55. We find the number of adult tickets sold by substituting into the rewritten equation: 108a + 108s = 8,390.00, or 108a + 108(55) = 8,390.00. This gives us 108a + 6,600 = 8,390.00, or 108a = 1,790.00. So, a = 16.25, and the number of adult tickets sold is 16.25. The answer is 16",

The weighted average of two numbers $a$ and $b$ with weights $x$ and $y$ is $\\frac{a \\cdot x + b \\cdot y}{x + y}$. Hence, the value of the mixture is $\\frac{2 \\cdot x + 3 \\cdot y}{x + y}$.

How many hours does the electrician work? ",
    "output": "Let x be the number of hours the bricklayer works and y be the number of hours the electrician works. We know that the total number of hours worked is 90, so x + y = 90. We also know that the bricklayer earns 12 dollars an hour, so x * 12 = the total amount of money the bricklayer earns. The electrician earns 16 dollars an hour, so y * 16 = the total amount of money the electrician earns. Since the owner pays them a total of 1350 dollars for their work, we can set up the following equation: x * 12 + y * 16 = 1350. Substituting y = 90 - x into the equation, we get x * 12 + (90 - x) * 16 = 1350. Expanding the right side, we get x * 12 + 1440 - 16x = 1350. Adding 16x to both sides, we get 32x + 1440 = 1350. Subtracting 1440 from both sides, we get 32x = 910. Dividing both sides by 32, we get x = 30.5. Therefore, the bricklayer works 30.5 hours, and the electrician works 90 - 30.5 = 59.5 hours.

    "output": "Let X be the number of children that attended the theatre. The number of adults that attended the theatre is 225-X. The total revenue from the children is 6*X. The total revenue from the adults is 9*(225-X). Since the total revenue is 1875 dollars, we have the equation 6*X + 9*(225-X) = 1875. This simplifies to 6*X + 2025 - 9*X = 1875. -3*X = -1475. X = 495. So, 495 children attended the theatre. The number of adults that attended is 225-495 = 175 adults. The answer is 175",

We are mixing x liters of the 5 % solution with y liters of the 25 % solution to get x + y liters of the 18 % solution. The amount of salt in the 5 % solution is 5 % of x, the amount of salt in the 25 % solution is 25 % of y, and the amount of salt in the 18 % solution is 18 % of x + y. We set up the equation 5 % of x + 25 % of y = 18 % of x + y and solve for x and y. 5 % of x + 25 % of y = 18 % of x + y is equivalent to 0.05x + 0.25y = 0.18x + y. Subtracting 0.18x from both sides, we get 0.07x = 0.25y - y = 0.15y. Dividing both sides by 0.07, we get x = 2y. Substituting this into the equation 5 % of x + 25 % of y = 18 % of x + y, we get 0.05(2y) + 0.25y = 0.18(2y) + y. Simplifying, we get 0.1y = 0.36y + y. Subtracting 0.36y from both sides, we get -0.26y = y. Dividing both sides by -0.26, we get y = 10 liters. Substituting this into the equation x = 2y, we get x = 2(10) = 20 liters. The answer is 20",

    "question": "A direct flight on delta air lines from Atlanta to Paris is 4000 miles and takes approximately 8 hours going East and 10 hours going West. Although the plane averages the same airspeed , there is a headwind while traveling East , resulting in a different air speeds. What is the average air speed of the plane in miles per hour and the average wind speed? ",
    "output": "Let x be the average air speed of the plane in miles per hour and y be the average wind speed. We can set up the equation 4000/x = 4000/y + 8 to solve for x and y. Multiplying both sides by x, we get 4000 = 4000/y + 8x. Rearranging the equation, we get 4000 - 8x = 4000/y. Since 4000/y is the ground speed of the plane, 4000 - 8x is the effective speed of the plane. Therefore, 4000 - 8x = 4000/y is the same as 4000/y = 4000 - 8x, which is the same as 4000 - 8x = 4000/y. Solving for y, we get y = 4000 - 8x. Substituting this into the original equation 4000/x = 4000/y + 8, we get 4000/x = 4000/(4000 - 8x) + 8. Multiplying both sides by x, we get 4000x = 4000(4000 - 8x) + 8x. Canceling out the 4000s on both sides, we get 4000x = 4000 - 32x. Rearranging the equation, we get 32x = 4000 - 4000x. Adding 4000x to both sides, we get 32x + 4000x = 4000. Canceling out the x, we get 32 + 4000 = 4000. Therefore, the average air speed of the plane is 4000/32 = 125 miles per hour and the average wind speed is 125 - 8 = 117 miles per hour. The answer is 117",

    "output": "Let x be the average miles per gallon obtained by the first car.\nThen (45-x) is the average miles per gallon obtained by the second car.\nMultiply the first car's average miles/gallon by the number of gallons it consumed: 40x.\nMultiply the second car's average miles/gallon by the number of gallons it consumed: 20(45-x).\nAdd the two quantities to obtain the total number of miles driven: 40x+20(45-x).\nThis number equals the total number of miles driven by the two cars, which is 1400.\nThus 40x+20(45-x)=1400.\nAfter multiplying, we have 40x+900-20x=1400.\nAfter combining like terms, we have 20x+900=1400.\nAfter subtracting 900 from both sides, we have 20x=500.\nAfter dividing both sides by 20, we have x=25.\nThus the first car's average gas mileage was 25 miles per gallon.\nThe second car's average gas mileage was 45-25=20 miles per gallon.\nThe answer is 25",

Since the amount invested in the account paying 6 % is 12000-x, the total return from the account paying 7.5 % is 7.5 % * x = 0.075x. The total return from the account paying 6 % is 6 % * (12000-x) = 0.06(12000-x). The total return from both accounts is 0.075x + 0.06(12000-x) = 840 dollars.
