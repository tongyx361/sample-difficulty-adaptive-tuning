    "question": "$$h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$$The equation above gives the height $h$, in feet, of a ball $t$ seconds after it is thrown straight up with an initial speed of $v$ feet per second from a height of $k$ feet. Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ? \nAnswer Choices: (A) $v=h+k-16 t$ (B) $v=\\frac{h-k+16}{t}$ (C) $v=\\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$ (D) $v=\\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$",
    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nWe know that when $t=0$, $h=k$. That is, when the ball is thrown, it is at height $k$. As $t$ gets larger, $h$ gets smaller. The only way that $h$ gets smaller as $t$ gets larger is if $v$ is a negative number. That is, if the ball is thrown up, $v$ must be negative. Now, as $t$ gets larger, $h$ gets closer and closer to $-16t^{2}$, and $-16t^{2}$ gets larger and larger. The only way for this to happen is if $v$ gets larger and larger. That is, if $v$ is a negative number, as $t$ gets larger, $h$ gets closer and closer to $-16t^{2}$, and $-16t^{2}$ gets larger and larger. This matches the behavior of the first choice: as $t$ gets larger, $-16t^{2}$ gets larger, and so $h$ must be equal to $-16t^{2}+v t+k$, which means $v=-16t$. The answer is A",

If $y=h(x)$ is graphed in the $x y$-plane, which of the following represents the real-life meaning of the positive $x$-intercept of the graph? \nAnswer Choices: (A) The initial height of the projectile (B) The maximum height of the projectile (C) The time at which the projectile reaches its maximum height (D) The time at which the projectile hits the ground",
    "output": "The $x$-intercept is the value of $x$ for which $h(x)=0$. By the quadratic formula, this is when: $$x = \\frac{-100 \\pm \\sqrt{100^2 - 4(-16)(10)}}{2(-16)}$$Because we want the positive $x$-intercept, we take the positive root: $$x = \\frac{-100 + \\sqrt{100^2 - 4(-16)(10)}}{2(-16)} = \\frac{-100 + \\sqrt{1600 + 6400}}{32} = \\frac{-100 + 80}{32} = \\frac{65}{16}$$This is the number of seconds after the projectile had been launched. To find the maximum height of the projectile, we take the derivative of the function: $$h'(x) = -32x + 100$$Find when this is equal to zero to find the maximum: $$-32x + 100 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{100}{32} = \\frac{125}{4}$$This is the number of seconds after the projectile had been launched. The maximum height is the value of $h$ at this time: $$h\\left(\\frac{125}{4}\\right) = -16 \\cdot \\frac{125}{4}^2 + 100 \\cdot \\frac{125}{4} + 10 = \\boxed{5250}.$$. The answer is 5250",
