Visualize a big circle: that's the space of everything that could happen with these two stocks next year, what statisticians call the \"sample space.\" That represents 100%. The \"B space\", the area of that space where Stock B increases is 74% of that space, so only 26% is outside the \"B space\". We don't know the relationship of Stock A & Stock B, but we'd like to know where to put Stock A on the diagram to maximize the area that's outside of both the \"A space\" and the \"B space.\" Well, with just the \"B space\" in the big circle, already 74% is taken up, and only 26% is free. If any of the \"A space\" is outside of the \"B space\", then it will eat up some of that free 26%. The only way to maximize that free space, to keep all 26% free, would be to put the entirety of the A space outside of the B space. That would be 56% of the total space, so only 26% is free.
