    "output": "Let $x$ be the amount of cream that must be removed.\n\nWe know that the total amount of milk is 1000 quarts.  If we let $m$ represent the amount of milk that remains after the butterfat is reduced, we have $m + x = 1000$.  We also know that the butterfat content of the milk is 4% and is reduced to 3% by the cream separation.  This gives us the equation $\\frac{4}{100}m + \\frac{23}{100}x = 3$.  Solving for $x$ in the second equation gives us $x = \\frac{100}{23}m$.  Substituting this into the first equation to eliminate $x$, we have $m + \\frac{100}{23}m = 1000$, or $\\frac{23}{23}m + \\frac{100}{23}m = 1000$.  Simplifying gives us $m = \\frac{1000}{23} = 45.45$, so the amount of cream that must be removed is $x = \\frac{1000}{23} - 45.45 = \\boxed{54.55}$ quarts. The answer is 54.55",

So, since 1 O atom has a mass of 16, 3.5 O atoms have a mass of 16 x 3.5 = 56 grams.  Therefore, the mass percentage of O in NaClO is 56 / 58 x 100% = 96.2%. The answer is 96",
