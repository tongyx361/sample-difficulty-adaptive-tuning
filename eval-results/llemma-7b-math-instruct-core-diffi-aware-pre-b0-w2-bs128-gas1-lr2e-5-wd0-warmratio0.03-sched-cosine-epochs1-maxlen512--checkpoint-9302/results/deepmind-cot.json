    "output": "First, we need to find h. We perform the operation in the numerator first, which gives us ((-8)/(-3))/((-10)/(-15)) = (8/3)/(10/15) = (8/3)/(2/3) = 4. Now we can rewrite the expression as (4)/((-10)/(-15)) = 4/((10)/15) = 4/(2/3) = 6. We now know that h = 6. We also need to find w, which we can find by performing the operations in the parentheses: (0 + -2)/2 - -4 = (-2)/2 - (-4) = -1 + 4 = 3. We now know what both h and w are, so we can set up the system of equations: 4*y = 5*s + 84 - 33, -39 = -w*y + h*s. We can multiply the second equation by 4, and we can then substitute in the values for w and h: 4*y = 5*s + 84 - 33, -39 = -3*y + 6*s. We now have a system of two equations with two variables, s and y: 4*y = 5*s + 84 - 33, -39 = -3*y + 6*s. We can solve this system as follows: 1. Multiply the first equation by 3: 3*(4*y) = 3*(5*s + 84 - 33), 12*y = 15*s + 252 - 99, 12*y = 15*s + 153, 2*y = 3*s + 27. 2. Multiply the second equation by 4: 4*(-39) = 4*(-3*y + 6*s), -156 = -12*y + 24*s. 3. Subtract the new second equation from the new first equation: -156 = -12*y + 24*s, 12*y = 15*s + 153, -39 = 3*s + 27, 99 = 3*s, 33 = s. 4. Substitute s = 33 into the new first equation: 12*y = 15*33 + 153, 12*y = 508, y = 43. The prime factors of y are 43. The answer is 43",

The square root of 44 is 2*sqrt(11), and the square root of 24 is 2*sqrt(6). This gives us ((sqrt(132)/sqrt(3)*2 - 2*sqrt(6))/(sqrt(6)/sqrt(486)))**2. Canceling the common factors gives us ((sqrt(486)*sqrt(2) - sqrt(6)*2)/sqrt(6))**2. Distributing the square gives us (sqrt(972) - sqrt(12))**2. We can simplify these two square roots as follows: sqrt(972) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(486) = sqrt(2)*2*sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(12)*sqrt(2) and sqrt(12) = sqrt(3)*sqrt(4) = sqrt(3)*2.

This simplifies to -23*sqrt(2) - 2*sqrt(2).\n\nThe denominator of the expression is (sqrt(54)/sqrt(2))*-1, or -3*sqrt(3).\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to ((-23*sqrt(2) - 2*sqrt(2))/(-3*sqrt(3)))^2*-2*1. To square the numerator, we get (-23*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(2))^2, which is (21*sqrt(2) + 2*sqrt(2))^2 = (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2. So, the expression simplifies to ((23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2/3*sqrt(3))^2*-2*1. To square the entire expression, we get ((23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2/3*sqrt(3))^2, which is (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^4/(3*sqrt(3))^2.\n\nThe denominator simplifies to 9, so the expression becomes (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^4/9. To simplify the numerator, we get (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^4, which is (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2*(23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2.\n\nSubstituting, we get ((23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2*(23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2)/9. To square, we get (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^4, which is (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2*(23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2.\n\nSubstituting, we get ((23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2*(23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2)/9, which simplifies to ((23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2)^2/9.\n\nTo square, we get (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^4, which is (23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2*(23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2.\n\nSubstituting, we get ((23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2*(23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2)/9, which simplifies to ((23*sqrt(2) + 4)^2)^2/9.\n\nThe answer is 23^2*2+4^2/9",

    "output": "First, we solve for y and h in terms of z using the given equations. We start with the first equation: 6 = -2*y + 3*h + 13. Next, we subtract 13 from both sides: -7 = -2*y + 3*h. Now, we multiply both sides by -1: 7 = 2*y - 3*h. Now, we subtract 3*h from both sides: 7 - 3*h = 2*y. Finally, we divide both sides by 2: 3.5 - 1.5*h = y.\nIn the second equation, we start by subtracting 4*h from both sides: -3*y + 4*h = -11 - 4*h. Next, we multiply both sides by -1: 3*y - 4*h = 11 + 4*h. Now, we add 3*h to both sides: 3*y = 15 + 4*h. Now, we subtract 15 from both sides: 3*y - 15 = 4*h. Finally, we divide both sides by 4: 3/4*y - 3/4*15 = h.\nWe now have equations in terms of z only: 3.5 - 1.5*h = y, 3/4*y - 3/4*15 = h, z - 3 = -3*z + y*i, 0 = z + i - 12. We can eliminate y and h from the equations by substituting the expressions we found earlier for y and h into the equations. We start with the first equation: 3.5 - 1.5*(3/4*y - 3/4*15) = y. Next, we multiply 3/4*y - 3/4*15 by 1.5: 1.5*3/4*y - 1.5*3/4*15 = 1.5*y. We can simplify 1.5*3/4*y to 3/4*y: 3/4*y - 3/4*15 = 1.5*y. Next, we add 3/4*15 to both sides: 3/4*y = 1.5*y + 3/4*15. We can simplify 1.5*y + 3/4*15 to 3/4*y + 3/4*15: 3/4*y = 3/4*y + 3/4*15. Finally, we subtract 3/4*y from both sides: 0 = 3/4*15. We can solve for z by dividing both sides by 3/4: z = 15/(3/4) = 20.\nWe now have the values for y and h, so we can find the values for i and z: i = (z - 3) / (-3*z + y*i) = (20 - 3) / (-3*20 + 3*3.5) = 17/105, z = 20. We can find the greatest common divisor of 77 and z: gcd(77, 20) = 1.\nThe answer is 1",

Plugging in r = -131, we get -(-131)*h + 8*h = i, or 131*h + 8*h = i.\nSo, h = i / 139.\nWe are almost done! We just need to solve -3*i + h = 20 for i.

This gives us (-11 + 16)*-53 = 5*-53 = -265.\nNow we can substitute (-265) for -(-11 - -16)*-53 in the original expression for h.

    "output": "We have  \\[1228 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 7.\\]Since $2^3 = 8 < 1228 < 2^4 = 16$, the eighth root of 1228 is some number between 2 and 4.  Since 3 is relatively prime to 8, the eighth root of 1228 is closer to $\\sqrt[8]{3^8} = 3$.  Since 13 is relatively prime to 8, the eighth root of 1228 is closer to $\\sqrt[8]{13^8} = 13$.  Since 7 is relatively prime to 8, the eighth root of 1228 is closer to $\\sqrt[8]{7^8} = 7$.  Therefore, the eighth root of 1228 is $\\boxed{3}$. The answer is 3",
