    "output": "Let x be the number of post card stamps.\nLet y be the number of letter stamps.\nThe total number of stamps is 50.\nThe total cost of the stamps is 12.60 dollars.\nSince the post card stamps cost 0.20 dollars each, the number of post card stamps times the cost of each stamp, which is x * 0.20, equals the total cost of the post card stamps, which is x * 0.20 = 12.60 - y * 0.33.\nSolving for x, we get x = (12.60 - y * 0.33) / 0.20.\nSince the number of letter stamps is y, the total number of stamps is 50, and the cost of each letter stamp is 0.33 dollars, we get y = 50 - (12.60 - y * 0.33) / 0.20.\nSolving for y, we get y = (50 * 0.20 - 12.60) / (0.33 - 0.20).\nWe now substitute x and y in the equation x + y = 50 to check if our answer is correct.\nSubstituting x, we get (12.60 - (12.60 - y * 0.33) / 0.20) + y = 50.\nSimplifying this, we get y * 0.33 / 0.20 + y = 50.\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 0.33y / 0.20 + y = 50.\nCombining like terms, we get 1.15y = 50 * 0.20.\nDividing both sides by 1.15, we get y = 50 * 0.20 / 1.15.\nSubstituting this value in the equation x + y = 50, we get x + 50 * 0.20 / 1.15 = 50.\nThis simplifies to x + 0.15y = 50.\nSubstituting the value of y we found, we get x + 0.15 * 50 * 0.20 / 1.15 = 50.\nThis simplifies to x + 0.33 = 50.\nSubtracting 0.33 from both sides, we get x = 50 - 0.33.\nThis gives us x = 49.67.\nSo, the number of post card stamps is 49.67.\nThe number of letter stamps is 50 - 49.67 = 0.33.\nThe answer is 0.33",

After simplifying, we get $2000(2x+40)=5(2x+40)(x+40)$. Expanding the right side and simplifying, we get $4000x+80000=5x^2+200x+2000$. Re-arranging, we get $5x^2-1900x+80000=0$. Factoring, we get $(5x-1500)(x-500)=0$. This gives us $x=500$ or $x=1500$. $1500$ miles per hour is an impossibility since the difference in speed is $40$ miles per hour, so the faster plane is moving at $500$ miles per hour and the slower plane is moving at $1500$ miles per hour.

    "output": "Let $c$ be the number of cows and $x$ be the number of chickens. We can use the following system of equations to represent the given information: \\begin{align*}\n4c + 2x &= 50 \\\\\nc + x &= 18 \\\\\n\\end{align*}We can solve for $c$ by subtracting $2x$ from both sides of the first equation and then multiplying both sides by 2. This gives us $2c = 100 - 4x$. We can solve for $x$ by subtracting $c$ from both sides of the second equation. This gives us $x = 18 - c$. We now have a system of two equations with two variables: \\begin{align*}\n2c &= 100 - 4x \\\\\nx &= 18 - c \\\\\n\\end{align*}We can solve for $c$ by substituting $18 - c$ into the first equation for $x$. This gives us $2c = 100 - 4(18 - c)$. Expanding the right side gives $2c = 100 - 72 + 4c$, or $2c = 28 + 4c$. Subtracting $4c$ from both sides gives $-2c = -28$, or $c = 14$. Substituting $14$ into $x = 18 - c$ gives $x = 18 - 14 = 4$. Thus, there are $\\boxed{14}$ cows and $\\boxed{4}$ chickens. The answer is 14",

    "output": "Let's begin by assigning variables. Let the cost of a football and a soccer ball be x and y respectively. We can create a system of two equations to represent the given information. 3x+y=155 and 2x+3y=220. We are asked to find the value of x and y. To solve for x, we need to eliminate y from the equations above. Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, we get 9x+3y=465 and 4x+6y=440. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get 5x+3y=225. Subtracting the cost of a football from the above equation, we get 5x=225-3y. Subtracting the cost of a soccer ball from the above equation, we get 5x=225-3y-y. 5x=225-4y. We can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5, and we can solve for y by substituting the value of x into the equation 5x=225-4y and solving for y. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5 gives x=45-8y. Substituting the value of x into the equation 5x=225-4y gives 5(45-8y)=225-4y. 225-4y=225-4y. The cost of a football is x=45-8y=45-8(45-8y)=45-8(45-8(45-8y))=127.5 dollars. The cost of a soccer ball is y=45-8y=45-8(45-8y)=45-8(45-8(45-8y))=112.5 dollars. The answer is 127.5",

We can solve for x using the equation 9y = 5x, which gives us x = 9y/5. Substituting this into the equation x + y = 50, we get 9y/5 + y = 50. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 9y + 5y = 250, which simplifies to 14y = 250. Dividing both sides by 14, we get y = 17.5. Substituting this into the equation x + y = 50, we get x = 50 - 17.5 = 32.5. Thus, 32.5 ml of the 5 % solution and 17.5 ml of the 10 % solution must be mixed to make 50 ml of a 9 % vinegar solution.\n\nThe answer is 32.5",
