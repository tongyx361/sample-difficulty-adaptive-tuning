    "output": "Calculating the square root of 628069819 directly would be quite complex. Instead, we can use an approximation method called the Babylonian method to find the square root. The method is based on the fact that the square root of a number is between the perfect squares that surround it. We will start with the largest perfect square less than 628069819 and the smallest perfect square greater than 628069819. \n\nThe largest perfect square less than 628069819 is 628069816 (which is 26424 * 26424).\nThe smallest perfect square greater than 628069819 is 628069824 (which is 26425 * 26425).\n\nNow, we will use the Babylonian method to find the square root of 628069819.\n\n1. Start with an initial guess. We will use the average of the two perfect squares we found, which is (628069816 + 628069824) / 2 = 628069820.\n2. Divide the number (628069819) by the initial guess (628069820) to get the quotient and remainder. In this case, the quotient is 0.999999999 and the remainder is 1.\n3. Multiply the initial guess by the quotient and add the remainder. In this case, 628069820 * 0.999999999 + 1 = 628069819.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the result converges to a fixed point or a desired level of accuracy.

We know that l = (-30)/b*(-4)/(-5).\nSubstituting b = 118/15 into the equation, we get l = (-30)/(118/15)*(-4)/(-5) = -30*15/118 * 4/5 = -180/118 = -45/59.\n\nNow we have the values for l and b, so we can solve the second equation for p.\nWe have -3*n + l*p - 7*p = -11, -4 = -p.\nSubstituting -4 for p, we get -3*n - 4*l - 7*(-4) = -11.\nThis simplifies to -3*n + 4*l + 28 = -11.\nSubstituting l = -45/59 into the equation, we get -3*n + 4*(-45/59) + 28 = -11.\nThis simplifies to -3*n - 180/59 + 28 = -11.\nAdding 11 to both sides, we get -3*n - 180/59 + 11*59/59 = 0.\nThis simplifies to -3*n + 11*59/59 = 180/59.\nDividing both sides by -3, we get n = -59/3 + 180/59 = (-59*59 + 180*3)/(3*59) = (59*(-11) + 180*3)/(3*59) = -11 + 180/59 = 169/59.\nThe answer is 169/59",

    "output": "First, we solve the system of equations to find j and t. Subtracting 6 from both sides of the second equation gives 6 = -3*j + 3*t. Now we can multiply the first equation through by 3 to get 3*(-5*t + 65 + 0) = 5*j*3, 165 - 15*t = 15*j. We can subtract the second equation from this to find 100 = 15*t - 15*j. Cancelling 15 from both sides gives 6.67 = t - j.\n\nNow we substitute this value of t-j into the equation for j to find j = 6.67 + t = 6.67 + 6.67 = 13.34. Substituting j = 13 into the equation for t gives t = 6.67 + 13 = 19.67. Substituting these values into the equation for n(q) gives n(6) = -6 - 13 + 2*6 - 3*6**2 = -19 + 72*6 - 108*6**2. Since 72*6 = 432 and 108*6**2 = 1152, n(6) = -19 + 432 - 1152 = -693. The tens digit of n(6) is 9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9",

    "output": "We begin by solving the third equation, -4*y = -l*t - 592, 7 + 18 = -5*t. Since 7 + 18 = 25 = -5*(-5), we see that t = -5. Thus, -4*y = -l*(-5) - 592, so 4*y = 5*l - 592.\nSubstituting 2*w = 3*w - 2*l from the second equation into the first, we get 5*b + 24 = 11*b, 2*w = 3*w - 2*l. Cancelling 2*w = 3*w from the second equation, we get -2*l = 24. Thus, 4*y = 5*l - 592 = 24 - 592 = -568. Since 568 = 8*71, the hundreds digit of y is $\\boxed{8}$. The answer is 8",

Since a negative number multiplied by -1 is positive, -15/16 becomes 15/16. Now let's simplify the fraction in the denominator. (-330)/440 = -330/440 = -33/44. So the expression becomes (15/16)/(-33/44). To divide two fractions, we multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction and the denominator of the first fraction by the numerator of the second fraction. So (15/16)*(44/33) = (15*44)/(16*33) = 660/528. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. So 660/528 = 330/264.

    "output": "We first solve the system of equations 5*k + 2*t = -t + 63, -2*t = 5*k - 62. Rearranging the first equation, we get 5*k + 2*t - t = 63, which simplifies to 4*k + t = 63. From the second equation, we get -2*t + 5*k = 62. We can solve this system by multiplying the second equation by 4 and subtracting it from the first equation, which gives (4*k + t) - 4*(5*k - 62) = 63 - 4*62. This simplifies to -19*k = -171, so k = 171/19. We can check that this value of k satisfies the original system of equations.\n\nNext, we solve the equation -4*j + 3 = -3*j. This simplifies to j = 3. We now solve the equation -j*y - 6 = -24, which simplifies to y = -24 + 6 = -18. We now calculate the highest common factor of y and k. Since 18 and 171 are relatively prime, the highest common factor of y and k is 1.\n\nWe can check our answer by finding the greatest common divisor of 18 and 171 using the Euclidean algorithm. 171 = 18*9 + 3, so the greatest common divisor of 18 and 171 is 3. Since our answer is 1, this means we have made a mistake. Going back to the original system of equations, we see that we have made an error in the calculation of k. The correct system of equations should be 5*k + 2*t = -t + 63 and -2*t = 5*k - 62. Solving this system, we get k = 31 and t = 17.
