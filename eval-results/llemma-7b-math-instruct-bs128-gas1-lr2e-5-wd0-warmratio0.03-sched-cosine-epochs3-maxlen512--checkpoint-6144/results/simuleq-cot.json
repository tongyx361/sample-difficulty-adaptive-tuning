We know that F + B = 900.\nWe also know that 12F + 10B = 9,780.\nWe can solve for F by subtracting 10B from both sides of the second equation, then substituting (900-B) into the equation for B.\n12F = 9,780 - 10B\n12F = 9,780 - 10(900-B)\n12F = 9,780 - 9,000 + 10B\n12F = 780 + 10B\n12F - 10B = 780\n2F - B = 39\nB = 2F - 39\nSubstituting this equation into the first equation, we get:\nF + (2F - 39) = 900\n3F - 39 = 900\n3F = 939\nF = 313\nSince Floor seats cost 12 dollars each, 313 floor seats were sold.\nSubstituting F into the second equation, we get:\n10B = 9,780 - 12(313)\n10B = 9,780 - 3,788\n10B = 6,092\nB = 609.2\nSince balcony seats cost 10 dollars each, 609.2 balcony seats were sold.\nThe answer is 313",

How much money is invested in the first investment and second investment respectively? ",
    "output": "Let's denote the amount invested in the first investment as x. So the amount invested in the second investment is 8000 - x.\nThe formula for simple interest is I = PRT/100, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest and T is the time.\nIn this case, the interest is 575 dollars, the rate of interest for the first investment is 8.5 % and the rate of interest for the second investment is 6.4 %. The time is 1 year.\nUsing the formula, we can write two equations:\n1) 575 = x * 8.5 * 1 / 100\n2) 575 = (8000 - x) * 6.4 * 1 / 100\nSolving the first equation for x, we get x = 575 * 100 / 8.5 = 6666.67 dollars.\nSo, the amount invested in the first investment is 6666.67 dollars.\nThe amount invested in the second investment is 8000 - 6666.67 = 1333.33 dollars.\nThe answer is 6666.67,1333.33",

We know that the plane averages the same air speed while going East and West, so the Eastward air speed is 222.22 miles per hour and the Westward air speed is 222.22 miles per hour.
