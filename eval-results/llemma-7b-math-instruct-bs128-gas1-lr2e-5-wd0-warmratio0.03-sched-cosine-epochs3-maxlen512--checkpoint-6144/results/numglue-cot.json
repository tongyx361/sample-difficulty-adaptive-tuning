Since the molar mass of HClO2 is 52.938 g/mol, the mass of H in 1 mole of HClO2 will be:\n\nMass of H in 1 mole of HClO2 = (Molar mass of H) / (Molar mass of HClO2) * 1 mole\n= (1.008 g/mol) / (52.938 g/mol) * 1 mole\n= 0.0186 g\n\nNow, we can find the mass percentage of H in HClO2.

In order to solve for $q$, we need to eliminate $p$ from the equations above. We can do this by multiplying the second equation by 2 and then subtracting the first equation from the result. This gives us:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(6p + 8q) - (4p + 5q) &= (3.16) - (2.00) \\\\\n2p + 3q &= 1.16 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can solve for $q$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $3$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}p + \\frac{3}{3}q &= \\frac{1.16}{3} \\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}p + q &= 0.3867 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can subtract $\\frac{2}{3}p$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nq &= 0.3867 - \\frac{2}{3}p \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe know that the cost of a pencil is less than the cost of a pen, so we can guess that the cost of a pencil is between 0 and 0.3867 dollars. If we assume that the cost of a pencil is 0.1 dollars, we can find the cost of a pen by plugging in the value of $p$ into the equation for $q$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nq &= 0.3867 - \\frac{2}{3}(0.1) \\\\\nq &= 0.3867 - 0.2 \\\\\nq &= 0.1867 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the cost of a pen is $\\boxed{0.1867}$ dollars.",

    "question": "A direct flight on delta air lines from Atlanta to Paris is 4000 miles and takes approximately 8 hours going East and 10 hours going West. Although the plane averages the same airspeed , there is a headwind while traveling East , resulting in a different air speeds. What is the average air speed of the plane in miles per hour?",
    "output": "Let's denote the air speed of the plane as $x$ and the speed of the headwind as $y$. Since the plane travels 4000 miles going East and 4000 miles going West, the time it takes to travel these distances are 8 hours and 10 hours respectively. Since the plane's air speed remains constant, we can use the formula $d=s\\cdot t$ to find the distances traveled. This gives us that the plane's speed going East is $x+y$ and its speed going West is $x-y$. From this, we can use the formula $d=s\\cdot t$ to find that the distance traveled going East is $(x+y)(8)$ and the distance traveled going West is $(x-y)(10)$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and subtracting the expressions gives us that $8x=70y$. Since $y$ represents the headwind, it must be less than $x$, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $8$ to find that $\\frac{x}{8}=\\frac{7}{5}y$. Adding $\\frac{7}{5}y$ to both sides gives us that $x=\\frac{70}{5}y=14y$. Since $y$ is the headwind, it must be less than $x$, so the smallest possible value for $y$ is $0$. When $y=0$, we have that $x=0$ as well. However, an airspeed cannot be $0$, so we must take into account the fact that the plane's speed is $x+y$ and not just $x$. Since the plane's speed going East is $x+y$, the smallest possible value for $x+y$ is $1$. From this, we can find that the average air speed of the plane is $\\frac{4000}{\\frac{70}{5}(1)+14}=\\frac{4000}{71}\\approx \\boxed{58.36}$. The answer is 58.36",

At noon , the price of the jackets was further reduced to 18.95 dollars. After the last jacket was sold , the total receipts for the clearance sale were 5108.30 dollars. How many jackets were sold before noon ?",
    "output": "Let X be the number of jackets sold before noon.\nSo, the number of jackets sold after noon is 214 - X.\nThe price per jacket before noon was 31.95 dollars, so the total price for X jackets sold before noon is 31.95X.\nThe price per jacket after noon is 18.95 dollars, so the total price for 214-X jackets sold after noon is 18.95(214-X).\nThe total amount of money received is 5108.30 dollars, so the equation is 31.95X + 18.95(214-X) = 5108.30.\nThere are 214 - X jackets left after noon, so 18.95(214-X) = 18.95 * 214 - 18.95X = 3986.3 - 18.95X.\nSo, the equation is 31.95X + 3986.3 - 18.95X = 5108.30.\nCombining like terms, we get 13.95X = 1112.00.\nDividing both sides by 13.95, we get X = 78.\nThe answer is 78",

If he kicks it with the same force in each situation, which road is more rough?? \nAnswer Choices: (A) gravel (B) asphalt",
    "output": "Let's think about the multi-choice question.\nOne way to determine which road is rougher is to compare the acceleration of the beach ball on each type of surface. Acceleration is defined as the change in velocity over time, which in this case is the change in the ball's momentum. The change in momentum for the beach ball is given by the impulse, or the force multiplied by the time over which it acts. Since the force applied to the beach ball is the same in each case, the difference in the acceleration of the ball tells us which surface is rougher.\nUsing the equation \u0394p = Ft, we can find the difference in momentum for the two cases. First, we need to find the time it takes for the ball to move down the road. The time it takes for the beach ball to travel 26 meters is 26/v, where v is the velocity of the ball. Similarly, the time it takes for the ball to travel 12 meters is 12/v. Since the force is the same in each case, the difference in momentum for the two cases is 26/v - 12/v = 14/v. The difference in acceleration is then 14/v.\nSince the difference in acceleration is inversely proportional to the velocity of the ball, we can see that the difference in acceleration is smaller for the gravel road than for the asphalt road. This means that the asphalt road is rougher than the gravel road.\nThe answer is B",
